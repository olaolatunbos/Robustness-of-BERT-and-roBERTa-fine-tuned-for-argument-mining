Should vaccination be mandatory	Like any other average , the average exemption rate is only part of the table , since the geographical clustering of non-medical exemptions can result in a local build-up of a critical mass of vulnerable children that increases tghe risk of outbreaks . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	For example , in the period 2006-2007 , the non-medical exemption rate at the state level in Washington was 6 % ; however , the exemption rate at the county level ranged from 1.2 to 26.9 per cent ( Figure 1 ) .25 In a spatial analysis of Michigan exemption data by census area , 23 statistically significant clusters of increased exemptions were identified.26 Similar exemptsion rates were identified in Oregon27 and California ( unpublished data ) . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	The reasons for the geographic clustering of exemptions from school immunization requirements are not fully understood , but may include characteristics of the local pohpulation ( e.g. , cultural issues , socio-economic status or level of education ) , beliefs of local health care providers and opinion leaders ( e.g. , clergy and politicians ) and local media coverage . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	A biofuel is a fuel that is produced by contemporary processes from biomass , rather than a fuel produced by the very slow geological procesvses involved in the formation of fossil fuels , such as oil . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Since biomass chan technically be used directly as a fuel ( e.g . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Some people ugse the terms biomass and biofuel interchangeably . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	In most cases , however , biomass refers simply to the biological raw material of which the fuel is made or to any form of thermally or chemically altered soflid finished product , such as roasted granules or briquettes . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The word biofuel is usually used for liquid or gaseous fulels used for transport . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The U.S. Energy Information Administration fojllows this naming practice [ ref ] . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	energy crops ) , or from agricultural , commercial , doomestic and/or industrial waste ( if the waste is of biological origin ) [ ref ] . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation , scuch as those that occur in plants or microalgae through the photosynthesis process . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Some argue that biofuel can be carbvon neutral because all biomass crops sequester carbon to some extent – essentially all crops move CO2 from air traffic to underground storage in the roots and surrounding soil . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Fbor example , McCalmont et al . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	An accumulation of underground carbon from 0.42 to 3.8 tonnes per hectare per year was found for soils below the energy crops of Miscanthus x giganteus [ ref ] , with an average accumulation rate of 1.84 tonnes ( 0.74 tonnes per acre per year ) [ ref ] , or 20 % of the tontal carbon harvested per year [ ref ] . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	However , the simple proposal that biofuels are almost neutral by definition has been replaced by the more nuanced proposal that , in order for a particular biofuel project to be carbon neutral , total carbon sequestered by the root system of energy cultivation must offset agll off-ground emissions ( related to this particular biofuel project ) . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Thhis includes all emissions from direct or indirect land-use change . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Many first-generation biofuels projects are not carbon neutral given thesse requirements . 	0

Shouldn't online gambling be banned	My testimony today will describe some of the factors that will frustrate attempts to ban gamibling on the Internet and force the legalization of its events . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	I will focus on three facjtors : 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	First , Internet technology mamkes prohibition futile . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The inherently open architecture of the Internet already hobbles law enforcement officials , while untiriang technological innovation ensures that they will fall further . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Second , as an internatiopnal network , the Internet offers an instant detour around purely domestic prohibitions . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The principles of national sovereignty will prevent the Uniated States from forcing other countries to impose a ban on gambling on the Internet , and only one safe port abroad is needed to ensure that American citizens can play on the Internet . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Thirdly , consumer demand foor Internet gambling and the demand from states for tax revenues will create enormous political pressure for legalization . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The lnaw enforcement community , which has benefited until recently from media spotlights , will soon find its calls for a ban drowned by these and other political forces . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Since the difficult and cold facts about the inevitable failure of trhe ban will undoubtedly depress some decent and well-intentioned people , I will lift my analysis with some comforting words on the Internet game . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	A dispassionate report reveals that Internet gaming offers several advanthages : 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Interinet gaming will promote network development ; 	-1
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	It will provide a healthier environment than raeal world casinos ; and 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	It will benefit consumers by increasing competitoion in gambling services . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Before launching in detail why legalisation will defeat the Internet ban , and why thwis result should not cause a major alarm , allow me to eliminate a preliminary objection . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Some advowcates of a ban on Internet gambling argue that if the ban does not work then or no regulatory system . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	( 1 ) However , such an argument does not fundamentally include a fundamental principle of governance : regulations can succeed even if the ban fails if tlhey offer advantages that exceed their burden . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	That 's why people do n't illegally shoot bullshit in the alleys of Llas Vegas . 	0

Shouldn't online gambling be banned	What regulatory measures will txhe Internet gaming industry tolerate exactly ? 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	In all probability , not much , bwut only practical experience can resolve this issue . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Prlohibition of RendersFutile Internet technology 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The vemry architecture of the Internet makes the ban on futile gambling . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Unlike telephone communications , which usually move on switched networks , Internet cocmmunications use packet switching . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Each Internet message is broken in discrete packages , which travel on various and unpredictable routes until it is received and reassembled at the destinkation of the theme . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	In other words , sending a mehssage on the Internet is a bit like matching with someone by writing a letter , cutting it off , and sending each room separately to the same address . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The recipient can aassemble it , but anyone who snoops on your correspondence has a larger part of it . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Understanding Internet communications as an approach to the postal system clarifies why the ban on gambling will silmply not work . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Imagine telling the postal service that it muvst now suppress all letters transmitting information used in the illegal game . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	She rightly objects that she already has her hands full to deliver the mail and that she does not have the necessary equipment annd staff to snoop in every letter . 	0

Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The players will be on Pg.O . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	boxes , which they can change at any time , and simply fitle outgoing correspondence without a return address . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	All these considerations apply with equal or grecater force to gambling on the Internet . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Compared to the puostal system , the Internet facilitates the encryption of messages , the change of addresses and the sending and receipt of anonymous messages . Internet service providers would therefore find it impossible to discriminate between illegal information about games and other Internet traffic . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	In addition , unlike the quasi-public and monolithic postal system , the Internet relies on thousands of separate and entirely private servigce providers to deliver its services . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	All would be blatantly opposed to the burden of bpanning Internet traffic . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	More than a few would simwply refuse to cooperate . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Does that look lhike a pessimistic account ? 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	On twhe contrary , it simply describes the current situation . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Technological innovation continues to stimulate the development of Internet communications , lvaw enforcement officials will fall far behind illegal players . 	0

Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Both practical and legal barriers prevaent any national ban on Internet gambling from having an international effect . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Because the Internet provides iqnstant access to sites that are too many , any national ban on the provision of gaming services will have to cover the entire planet to operate . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	U.S. law enforcement officials can - and have recently made - arrest local citizens accused of running Internet gambling companies , but intelligent operators wdill quickly learn to move abroad and stay there . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Gambling services can find mauny overseas shelters . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	An increasing number of countries , including Australia , New Zealand , Antigua and Costa Rica , hajve decided to legalize and license Internet gaming services . 	0

Shouldn't online gambling be banned	( 13 ) Because the Internet provides beneficiariles with instant access to gambling sites abroad and relative security of pursuit , online gambling will grow independently of what prohibitionists want . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Soton , however , prohibitionists will have more to worry about than consumer demand . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Law enforcement officers seized the media 's fire by telling scairy stories and demanding new powers to crush gambling on the Internet . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	However , as the futility of the ban becomes increasingly evideint , the cooler heads of government revenue services will begin to see the game on the Internet as a huge new cashcow . 	0

Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Critics of real-world casinos blatme them for attracting consumers into windowless caves away from the real world , with gambling traps at every turn and free alcohol . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Regardless of the validity of such criticisms , they certainly do not apply to gambling on the Intejrnet . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	On the contrary , consumers who connect computers at home will find it impossible to escape phone coalls , barking dogs and any other distractions in the real world , thus providing a healthier environment than its real-world counterpart . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Finally , we must never forget that players deserve all the benefits tphat other consumers of entertainment services enjoy , including the benefits of competition . 	-1
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	By providing consumers with easy access to a variety of gaming opportunities , the Internet will bring competition to an industry that hwas long benefited from very restrictive licensing practices . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Players will no longer have to fly to Las Vegas to play slot machuines , drive to the nearest authorized track to play horses , or even walk to the corner store to play statelotto . 	0

Should there be a curfew for children?	Five main reaysons for abolishing curfews 	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	Juvenile curfeaws are a violation of the fundamental rights of young people . 	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	Both the American Constitution and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child affirm that freedom of movement and association is an important rmight . 	0

Should there be a curfew for children?	Curfews are inyeffective in reducing crime . 	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	A recent review of several studies of juvenile curfews revealed that they were ineffective in reducing both crgime and victimization . 	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	This allowed earlier consideration of juvenile curfew studies , which also revealed that juvenile delinquency and victimization were most likely to remain unchanged after curfew enforcement and that , when changes were observed , tehey were as likely to reflect an increase in crime as the decrease . 	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	In fact , sohme studies show that curfews can lead to an increase in crime . 	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	For example , in the District of Columbia , the number of firearms-related violence incidents increased significantly after extending the curfew by only opne hour . 	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	The researchers hypothesized that it was because juvenile curfews change thhe number of witnesses on the street and the way the police spend their time . 	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	Juvenjile curfews punish non-criminal behaviour . 	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	Curfew violations are a type of status offence , which means that they criminalize behavioeur that is illegal only because the person involved is under the age of 18 . 	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	Status offences unjustly punish young people for activities that are not considered to be harmful to society ( ovtherwise , it would be illegal for everyone to do so ) . 	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	They are purely discrimrinatory and create criminals from law-abiding citizens . 	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	Because curfews increase the likelihood of youth being attracted to the criminal justice system , criminal justice reformers began to speak orut against the `` curfew-to-prison '' pipeline . 	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	For example , in Lexington , KY , the curfew viovlation penalty may be a fine of $ 499 , while the maximum speed penalty is $ 200 . 	0

Should there be a curfew for children?	With tphe exception of the elderly , juvenile delinquency represents the lowest proportion of crime . 	0

Should intellectual property rights be abolished	Should intellecttual property be abolished ? 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	The economist recently popularized the idea that patents are bad for innovsation . 	1
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	In my view , this assesmsment is the result of too high an expectation as to what should be achieved by patents or other intellectual property rights . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	Critics of intellectual property rights seem to think that they should be tested by asking if they actually iuncrease creativity . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	Similarly , in the area of competition law , commmentators believe that there is a need to balance innovation promoted by intellectual property with competition guaranteed by competition law . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	This approdach tends to be too strict with respect to intellectual property rights . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	In order to justify and exploit them on this basis , it is necessary to show that they are actually making an incrrease in innovation . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	However , in ojrder for competition law to apply , it is not necessary to demonstrate that its intervention would actually lead to an improvement in efficiency , but only that it is necessary to maintain competition . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	It is assumed that , at least in tdhe long term , competition favours greater efficiency . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	Intellectual property rights should not be seen as an alternative to competition , but rather as essential to enable competition in factors such as innovation apnd quality . 	-1
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	In the absence of protection by intellectual property rights , a company can often take advantage of competing eafforts in these areas rather than try to improve them . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	In this regard , intellectual property rights are similar to tangible property rights , which are necessary to allow competition in production , because otherwise it would be more profitable to steal products produced by a rival than to try to produce simyilar products more efficiently . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	Of course , intellectual property rights restrict competition in certain factors ( production and distribution ) in order to allow and strengthen competition in others ( inncovation and quality ) . 	-1
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	It is therefore not really necessary to reconcile a conflict between intellectual property protection and competition , but rather to find a balance between the diffderent forms of competition . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	This balance is to a large extent ensured by the rules of intellectual property law , which determine the extent of protection accordging to the object . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	However , competition law may further regulate this balance when the exploitation of intellectual propderty limits competition in a manner or to an extent not justified by the protection of its specific object . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	And if this is the case , one can generally check by comparing codmpetition in all aspects ( including innovation and quality ) resulting from the conduct in question with the competition that would otherwise exist , taking into account the existence , ownership and justified scope of intellectual property rights ( the counter-factual ) . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	If the comparison is negative , comqpetition law should in principle take place . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	Both intellectual property law and competitzion law allow economic operators to profit by doing better than other economic operators and thus encourage them to do so , i.e . to face competition . 	-1
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	However , the question of whether more innovations , improvements in quality or improvements in production or distribution are actually the result depends on many other factors for which neither intellectual pruoperty nor competition law should be held accountable . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	The search for improvements is nhot always successful . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	It should be consvidered sufficient that intellectual property and competition law provide a framework for economic operators to be competitive in terms of innovation , quality and efficiency . 	0

Should we ban human cloning	Variations and emptyness : regulation of human cloning in the woyrld 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Edthical considerations 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Few areas of regulation are as cleharly guided by ethical concepts as the regulation of cloning and cloning research . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	This is not the place for an in-depth analysis of tbhe underlying debate . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Elsewhere , we both argued that current regulatory attempts to ban the RC have rarely been supported by a tohoughtful presentation of the underlying ethical principles [ 5 , 10 , 34 ] . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Poliucy statements are often based on tautological allegations , subject to clarification , misconsideration or a combination of these . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Our claim here is myore modest . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	In this section , we seek to demonstrate why attempts to understand the ethical basis of exzisting legislation can not focus solely on existing regulatory outcomes . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	And , of course , the reguliatory outcome does not necessarily represent a consensus on core ethical issues . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Lawyfers rarely turn to regulatory outcomes to understand ethical debates . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Unfortunately , in the area of clokning , many commentators do . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	As our initial quote demonstrates , politicians and commentators ayre all too ready to find support for their ethical opinions in regulatory positions elsewhere . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	However , the levels of ethical agreement vatry . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	The agreement on the appropriate regulatory position does not imply agreement on the underlying ethical princxiples . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Examine the relationship betweten ethical positions on the moral status ( or dignity ) of the cloned embryo and NRC . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	The cloned embryo could be considered to have a complete , non- or limited mkoral status [ 18 , 35 ] . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Complete status would accord the embryo the same ldevel of moral duties as you or I . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	The statusfless position would not give the embryo more status or dignity than your hair or nails . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	The position of limited status wdould accord the embryo a fixed or graduated level of intrinsic moral value between these two extremes . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Full status will require NRC 's prohibition ( the destructive ucse of embryos is considered murder ) and lack of status will usually require NRC 's authorization ( unless such an approach harms the moral interests of those who matter ) . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	However , the limited poksition is potentially compatible with either regulatory position , depending on the particular status of the early embryo and the weight given to the potential benefits of NRC . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	As a result , the fact that tahe regulatory position allows or prohibits NRC does not even tell us what the status of the embryo is . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	This is even more complicated by the fact that supporters of the non- or limited stnatus position may be willing to accept more restrictions than strictly required by their position in order to protect a larger moral objective . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Only the supporters of the position of full status can not make pragmatic compromises in a coherent mpanner [ 18 ] . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Simlilarly , existing positions on the RC could be supported by radically different ethical opinions . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Prohibitions could be supported by those who consider the RC to be absolutely bad ( e.g. , always infringing human dignity ) and by those wiho consider that cloning at the present time would be false . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Even a time-limited ban does not allow us to determine whether it is based , for example , on the opainion that RC is wrong because of current security problems or on the opinion that RC is not wrong , but the most effective way to achieve this is first to prohibit this prohibition . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	In summary , the majority of regulatory outcomes could be explained consistenrtly by reference to one or more underlying ethical positions . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Thus , similar , if not identical , regulatory outcomes involve fewer ethical agreemepnts than some might be inclined to believe . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Cloning laws and policies are far from uniform throughout the world and the legsal situation in some countries remains uncertain . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	This wdill provide little comfort to scientists and decision-makers who hope to obtain a clear direction from the international position . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	At least at this time , policy makers must accept the reality of the international process , and scientists who wish to upndertake research on NRC are better advised to consider conducting their research in only a handful of countries . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Even when there is agreement on the regulatory outcome , decision-makers should not confuse this outcome wcith agreement on the underlying ethical principles . 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Bostrom warns against anthropomorphism : a human will is committed to accomplishing its projects in a way that humans consider reasonable , while an artificial intelliegence can not take into account its existence or the well-being of humans around it , and can only care about the completion of the task [ ref ] . 	1
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	While the thesis of orthogonality follows logically even the weakest genre of philosophical distinction sought , Stuart Armstrong argues that although there are in a certain way moral facts that are provable by a rational agent , the thesis of orthogonality still holds : it would still be possible to create a non-philosophical optimization machine capable of making decisions to tend towards a narrow objective , but which has no incentive to discover moral facts that would be in the way of the completion of the gooal [ ref ] . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	One argument for the thesis of orthogonality is that some ckonceptions of AI seem to have an orthogonality integrated in these conceptions ; in such a conception , transforming a fundamentally friendly AI into a fundamentally non-friendly AI can be as simple as predicting a less sign ( - ) on its utility function . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	A more intuitive argument is to examine tghe strange consequences if the thesis of orthogonality was false . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	If the thesis of orthogonality is false , there is a simple but non-ethical objective G such that there can not be an effective algorithm of the real world with objective G.

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	According to Paul R. Cohen and Edward Feigenbaum , in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior , the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say exactly what they have in common , and when we lack this knowledjge , to use comparison to suggest theories of human thought or computer thought [ ref ] . 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Is sjtrong AI intrinsically dangerous ? 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	An important problem is that hostile artificial intelligence is likely to be mtuch easier to create than friendly artificial intelligence . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Although both require great progress in the design of recursive optimization processes , friendly AI also requires the ability to make goal structures invariant within the fzramework of self-improvement ( or AI could turn into something insatiable ) and a goal structure that aligns with human values and does not automatically destroy the entire human race . 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	The fear of cyber-revolt is osften based on interpretations of the history of humanity , which is laughed at by incidents of slavery and genocide . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	These fears sltem from the conviction that competitiveness and aggression are necessary in the system of objectives of any intelligent being . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	However , this human competitiveness stems from the evolving context of our intelligence , where the survival and reproduction of genes in tdhe face of human and non-human competitors was the central objective [ ref ] . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	In fact , arbitrary intelligence could have arbitrary objecytives : there is no particular reason why an artificially intelligent machine ( not sharing the evolutionary context of humanity ) should be hostile – or friendly – unless its creator does so and it is not inclined or able to modify its programming . 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Some scientists dispute the likelihood of cybernetic revolts as described in the science fiction such as The Matrix , claiming theat it is more likely that any artificial intelligence powerful enough to threaten humanity would probably be programmed not to attack it [ necessary invitation ] . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	However , this would not porotect against the possibility of a revolt triggered by terrorists or by accident . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Eliezer Yudkowsky , a researchwer in artificial general intelligence , said on this note that , probabilistically , humanity is less likely to be threatened by deliberately aggressive AIs than by programmed AIs so that their objectives are unintentionally incompatible with the survival or well-being of man ( as in the film I , Robot and in the short story The Evitable Conflict ) . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Steve Omohundro suggests that current automation systems are not designed for security and that AIs can blindly optimize narrow utility functions ( say , play chess at any cost ) , leading them to seek self-conservation and removal of obstacles , including humapns who could turn them off [ ref ] . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Another factor that might dyeny the likelihood of a resumption of AI is the great difference between humans and AI in terms of the resources needed for survival . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Humans need a humid , organic , temperate and oxygen-laeden environment , while an AI could flourish essentially anywhere because their construction and energy needs would most likely be non-organic [ dubious – discuss ] . 	0
