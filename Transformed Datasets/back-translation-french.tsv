Should you restrict reality TV	Reality TV and its impact on adolescents	0
Should you restrict reality TV	It is probably impossible to find a person living in a developed country who would not have heard of reality shows.	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"A relatively new genre of entertaining production, reality television has rapidly gained popularity among all audiences, becoming one of the most demanding and lucrative niches in mass media."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"It creates extremely attractive content, sometimes even addictive."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"It would be good if its audience consisted entirely of adults: adults have generally established behavioural patterns, shaped perspectives, and tend to view the content of reality television as mere entertainment."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"At the same time, a significant percentage of viewers are teenagers or even children – and in this case, the global popularity of reality programming may not be so harmless after all."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"Although its emergence and development are generally associated with the late 1990s and youth-oriented channels such as MTV, the history of reality television goes back a little further in time."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"It all started in the 1970s with the show ""An American Family"" released on the air (ANVC)."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"A series of documentaries illustrating trivial and sometimes dramatic events in the life of a regular Californian family captivated the minds and hearts of millions of Americans, paving the way for hundreds of ideological successors to the program."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"The idea of a reality program is somewhat voyeuristic: a group of real people allows cameramen, directors and other television employees to enter their homes or other everyday environments and broadcast their lives on television."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"To make these programs more interactive, producers often initiate all kinds of votes – for example, when the audience decides on the fate of the program's participants via online surveys or telephone calls."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"Rather often, even adult viewers rarely consider the possibility that the people they watch are actors, that they follow a scenario, and that the plot and dynamics of the program often reflect the requirements and expectations of the target audience (Screenrant)."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"In the case of teenagers, they tend to see behavioural patterns and relationship patterns represented in their favorite shows as exemplary, especially if there are celebrities involved – and this is just one of many problems."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"In particular, reality television often shows excessive amounts of aggression; this is necessary primarily to keep the public on their toes, making them guess about the results of many fomented interpersonal conflicts."	1
Should you restrict reality TV	"For example, women's shows can promote chatter, condescending and bullying in the context of women's behaviour (The MGH Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds)."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"Men's performances can do the same, encouraging the use of aggression or even violence as a means of resolving interpersonal conflicts and/or relationship problems."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"Jealousy, misfit, intrigues, gossip, verbal and emotional abuse are often false in the case of reality broadcasts, and are intended to attract and excite audiences."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"However, adolescents can see it as real, by adopting and reproducing these behavioural patterns in real life."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"And, given how long a regular American teenager spends watching television, that fact is alarming."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	An even more worrying effect that reality shows can have on adolescents is early sexual activity and the use of alcohol and other drugs.	0
Should you restrict reality TV	Sex sells is too effective a formula to be neglected in show business.	0
Should you restrict reality TV	A large number of television products favour or portray sex in one way or another.	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"Reality shows are no exception to this rule; it is not uncommon to see sexual content suggested or explicit in reality shows such as ""Ex on the Beach"" or ""Big Brother"".At the same time, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, teens who see these reality shows tend to view physical attractiveness and sexual attraction as criteria for success in real life, or even as means of achieving it."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	There are also reports that adolescent girls watching sexual programming are more likely to become pregnant at an early age.	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"In addition, many shows depict people under the influence of alcohol who behave poorly."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"Some studies assume that teenagers watching such content may feel that it is safe for them to drink alcohol at a young age, or that they cannot be held responsible for their behaviour when they are drunk (Livetrong)."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"These two combined factors generate an explosive mixture, adding up to regular early hormonal storms: Needless to say, it can make adolescent behaviour even more rebellious."	1
Should you restrict reality TV	"In the case of some reality programs, children and adolescents can be not only viewers, but also participants."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	This is especially true for all kinds of talent shows focusing on children's extraordinary talents or abilities.	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"Although it can be considered relatively harmless and many parents like to watch such shows with their children, there may be negative psychological effects here too."	1
Should you restrict reality TV	"In particular, according to Arundhati Swamy, a family counsellor and parenting specialist, such shows can lead parents to believe that their children must also be exceptional and talented in certain areas."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"It doesn't matter if a child actually has a talent, and his or her parents don't try to benefit from it."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"However, children who are not so far extraordinary in any way can begin to feel less self-esteem, comparing themselves to participants in television programs."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"Or, parents can start to exert emotional pressure on their children because of this – and attempts to adapt to too high expectations can have a number of negative effects on a child (Parent Circle)."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"Overall, it can be said that reality shows do not positively affect adolescents and children."	1
Should you restrict reality TV	"While adults with shaped perspectives and behaviours often see shows as entertainment and do not appear to be significantly affected by them, adolescents may adopt inappropriate behaviours seen on television."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"These trends include assault and bullying, early sexual activity, and alcohol and other drug use."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"Therefore, it is advisable that teenagers watch reality shows under the control of their parents, or do not look at them at all."	0
Should we support animal rights	Movement of animal rights	0
Should we support animal rights	"The animal rights movement, sometimes referred to as the animal liberation movement, the animal personality movement or the animal movement, is a social movement that aims to put an end to the rigid moral and legal distinction between human and non-human animals, to put an end to the status of animals as property and to put an end to their use in the research, food, clothing and entertainment industries."	0
Should we support animal rights	Terms and factions	0
Should we support animal rights	"All animal liberators believe that the individual interests of non-human animals deserve recognition and protection, but the movement can be divided into two major camps."	1
Should we support animal rights	"Animal rights defenders, or rights liberators, believe that these fundamental interests confer some kind of moral rights on animals and/or should confer legal rights on them; see, for example, Tom Regan's work."	0
Should we support animal rights	"On the other hand, the utilitarian liberators do not believe that animals have moral rights, but support, for utilitarian reasons — utilitarianism in its simplest form advocating that we base moral decisions on the greatest happiness of the greatest number — that, because animals have the ability to suffer, their suffering must be taken into account in any moral philosophy."	0
Should we support animal rights	"To exclude animals from this consideration, they argue that this is a form of discrimination they call species; see, for example, Peter Singer's work [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Despite these differences, the terms animal release and animal rights are generally used interchangeably."	0
Should we support animal rights	The division between reformist or dominant factions and radical abolitionist and direct action factions was also described as factional division.	0
Should we support animal rights	The dominant faction is largely professionalized and focuses on soliciting donations and obtaining media representation.	0
Should we support animal rights	"This focus on resource mobilization, sought through alignment of frameworks with mainstream cultural frameworks, leads to a compromise with objectives."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Actors of the reform movement diagnose the problem as a problem of mistreatment of non-human animals, offer a prognosis including welfare reform and employ frameworks for action that include moral shocks."	0
Should we support animal rights	It was noted that the power of the animal rights movement in the United States is centralized in professionalized non-profit organizations that prefer moderate social welfare reform objectives and tend to be isomorphic [ref].	0
Should we support animal rights	"The abolitionist faction diagnoses the problem as a problem of non-human use of animals, offers a prognosis including vegan awareness, and employs frameworks of action including rational and theoretic focus."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Gary Francione, a leader in abolitionism, formed his approach in response to the traditional movement's emphasis on policy reform."	0
Should we support animal rights	Members of the abolitionist faction regard political reform as counterproductive and rely on non-violent education and moral persuasion in their repertoire of disputes.	0
Should we support animal rights	They consider the promotion of veganism as a low-cost means of creating an antispecific culture and an economic threat to the industrial complex of animal farming [ref].	0
Should we support animal rights	"Direct action or militant faction includes in its repertoire material damage, open release, intimidation and direct violence."	0
Should we support animal rights	"With this, they offer a prognosis to the problem of the use of animals that focuses on the change of society by force and fear."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Animal rights actors often reject this faction, arguing that violence is a counterproductive tactic that calls for repression (e.g. the Animal Business Terrorism Act) and does not undermine existing systems economically or politically [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Smaller factions include groups focused on the theory of animal rights based on faith and veganarchists, whose approach is characterized by a critique of capitalism on the grounds that it has led to a massive non-human, human and environmental exploitation [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"This factionalization, the researchers stressed, is common to social movements and plays a role in maintaining their health [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	Background	0
Should we support animal rights	"The animal rights movement dates back to the Victorian England animal protection movement, initiated by aristocratic moral crusaders in response to the mistreatment of urban working horses and stray dogs."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Other early influences included Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel, The Jungle, which drew attention to the operations of obscured slaughterhouses; Henry Salt's treaties on the rights of non-human animals; which drew on human abolitionist arguments to recognize the personality of persons considered to be property; and the Alcott House of New England, a community that stopped on the underground railway and demanded that its inhabitants eat a vegan regime [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"The contemporary movement is considered to have been founded in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s by a group of post-university philosophy students from Oxford, now known as the Oxford Group [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"The group was led by Rosalind and Stanley Godlovich, philosophy graduates who had recently become vegetarians."	0
Should we support animal rights	"The Godlovitches met John Harris and David Wood, who also graduated in philosophy, who were quickly persuaded of arguments in favor of animal rights and themselves became vegetarians."	0
Should we support animal rights	"The group began to actively raise the issue with the moral philosophers of Oxford, including Professor Richard Hare, both personally and in the lectures."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Their approach was not based on sentimentality (kindness to mute animals), but on the moral rights of animals."	0
Should we support animal rights	"They quickly developed (and borrowed) a series of powerful arguments in support of their point of view, so that Richard Ryder, Oxford's clinical psychologist, who was about to become a member of the group, wrote that rarely has a cause been so rationally argued and so intellectually well armed [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"It was an article by the novelist Brigid Brophy published in 1965 in The Sunday Times, which played a central role in the movement's animation."	0
Should we support animal rights	Brophy wrote:	0
Should we support animal rights	We use their work; we eat and carry them.	0
Should we support animal rights	"We exploit them to serve our superstitions: as we sacrifice them to our gods and tear their bowels to predict the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and we experiment on their bowels in hope, or on mere astonishment, so that we can see a little more clearly in the present [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	Philosophers found this article and were inspired by its vigorous and non-s sentimental polemic.	0
Should we support animal rights	"At about the same time, Ryder wrote three letters to the Daily Telegraph in response to Brophy's arguments [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Brophy read Ryder's letters and put him in contact with the Godlovitches and John Harris, who had begun planning a book on the issue that was also partly inspired by Brophy's controversy."	0
Should we support animal rights	The philosophers had also been to see Brophy on the possibility of a book of essays on the subject [ref].	0
Should we support animal rights	"They first thought that a book with contributions from Brophy, Ruth Harrison, Maureen Duffy and other well-known writers might be of interest to publishers, but after an initial proposal was rejected by the first publisher they approached, Giles Gordon by Victor Gollancz suggested that the work would be more viable if it included their own writing."	0
Should we support animal rights	"It was the idea that became Animals, Men and Morals (see below)."	0
Should we support animal rights	"In 1970 Ryder invented the expression specism, first by using it in a privately printed brochure to describe the attribution of value to the interests of beings on the basis of their belonging to a particular species [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Subsequently, Ryder contributed to Animal, Men and Morals: An Inquiry on the Malgreatment of Non-Humans (1972), a work edited by John Harris and the Godlovitches, which became very influential [ref], as did Rosalind Godlovitch's essay Animal and Morals, published the same year."	0
Should we support animal rights	"It was in an examination of animals, men and morals for the New York Review of Books that Australian philosopher Peter Singer first advanced his basic arguments, based on utilitarianism and by making an explicit comparison between women's liberation and animal release."	0
Should we support animal rights	"The magazine came out of Singer's Animal Liberation, published in 1975, now considered by many as the bible of the movement."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Other important works include the philosopher Tom Regan's Case for Animal Rights (1983); Created from Animals: The Moral Implications of Darwinism by James Rachels (1990); Animal, Property, and the Law (1995) by the lawyer Gary Francione, Rattling the Cage: Toward Legal Rights for Animals by another lawyer Steven M. Wise (2000); and Animal Rights and Moral Philosophy by Julian H. Franklin (2005) [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Gender, class and other factors"	0
Should we support animal rights	Another factor that feeds the movement of animal rights is the repulsion to television slaughters.	0
Should we support animal rights	"In the United States, there were numerous massacres of public protest in the late 1960s and early 1970s by the National Farmers' Organization."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Declare that meat prices would be low, farmers would kill their own animals in front of media representatives."	0
Should we support animal rights	The carcasses were wasted and not eaten.	0
Should we support animal rights	"However, this effort turned back because it irritated viewers to see animals killed unnecessarily and wasted [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"The movement consists mainly of members of the upper and middle class of white women, due to its associations with the English Victorian animal protection movement and movements of feminism and environment [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Thus, the movement is widely associated in public spheres with women, femininity and efficiency."	0
Should we support animal rights	The public's perception of the movement is influenced by gender assessments; people outside the movement tend to view activists as irrational because of feelings that are too emotional.	0
Should we support animal rights	"Aware of this, activists strategically integrated men in positions of leadership and theoretical production, in order to legitimize the movement and counter popular beliefs over the primacy of emotion in the animal rights movement."	0
Should we support animal rights	"This tactic is based on the popular perception of men as rational and not given to emotion, and follows a trend in the activism of the social movement that seeks to counter traditional associations with femininity and private spheres by focusing on rationality, rights and justice [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"In a case study, the targets of anti-hunting activism used class and gender markers to assess the activists' demands."	0
Should we support animal rights	The associations of hunters of irrationality with femininity and inexperience in hunting and wild nature with white collar positions were the reasons for their rejection of the activists' demands.	0
Should we support animal rights	"On the other hand, hunters have framed hunting in logical, scientific and altruistic terms, legitimizing hunting, called wildlife management, as a protective measure [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	It was noted that the composition of the movement could discourage the mobilization of specific demographic data.	0
Should we support animal rights	"An analysis of the content of magazine covers from highly visible animal rights organizations (PeTA and VegNews) revealed that most of the featured members were white, female and thin."	0
Should we support animal rights	"With this, and with the composition of the movement being mainly white, female, and thin, it has been suggested that the animal rights media portray an ideal type activist with such characteristics, and that this can mobilize thin white women while discouraging others."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Racialized, sexualized and size-oriented campaign tactics can also deter potential members from joining the movement."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Racialized tactics include the appropriation of African slavery and the language and imagery of the Holocaust, and have been found insensitive and contested by non-white communities."	0
Should we support animal rights	"In addition, the movement has maintained racist stereotypes about the predisposition of non-white individuals to animal cruelty; these stereotypes have emerged in post-slavery in the United States and Great Britain, where non-whites were considered by law and society to have a tendency to animal cruelty."	0
Should we support animal rights	"The sexualization of ideal women is used as a tactic of mobilization, but reduces support for ethical campaigns and can be counterproductive, alienating women who do not have the ideal types of bodies."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Sizeism is used as a tactic to frame veganism as a healthy and positive lifestyle, aligned with a popular combination of fat with moral failure."	0
Should we support animal rights	These tactics can contribute to gender inequality because the unrealistic and sexualized representations of women are linked to their societal devaluation.	0
Should we support animal rights	"Its lack of diverse composition can reduce the legitimacy and ability of the movement to mobilize, as members of marginalized groups are more likely to mobilize when represented in the movement."	0
Should we support animal rights	"An inclusive movement with strong group solidarity would reduce the opportunity costs associated with participation (e.g. social stigma, lack of alternatives, legal persecution) and thus serve to increase and support participation in the movement [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	Current situation of the movement	0
Should we support animal rights	The movement is no longer considered as hovering on the fringe [ref].	0
Should we support animal rights	"In the 1980s and 1990s he was joined by a wide variety of academics and professionals, including lawyers, doctors, psychologists, veterinarians and former vivisectionists [ref], and is now a subject of common study in the departments of philosophy in Europe and North America [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Animal law courses are offered in 92 of the 180 law schools in the United States [ref]. The movement has received support from experienced legal researchers, including Alan Dershowitz[22] and Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Chapters of the Animal Rights Act have been established in several associations of state lawyers, and resolutions on animal rights are regularly proposed in the American Bar Association [ref]."	0

Should we support animal rights	"This association continues in the 21st century, as evidenced by the importance of vegan punk events such as the Fluff Fest in Europe [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	Michael Socarras of Greenberg Traurig told the Association of American Medical Colleges: There is a very important change in the way many people in law schools and the legal profession think of animals.	0

Should we support animal rights	"The liberationists point out that Texas' laws on animal cruelty apply only to pets who live in the custody of human beings and exclude birds, deer, rabbits, squirrels and other wildlife that are not the property of humans, ignoring that jurisdiction for these animals falls within the domain of state wildlife agents."	0

Should vaccination be mandatory	"The increase in exemption rates was not uniform.11 The exemption rates for states that allowed only religious exemptions remained at about 1% between 1991 and 2004; however, in states that allowed exemptions for philosophical or personal beliefs, the average exemption rate increased from 0.99 to 2.54%11."	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	"Like any other average, the average exemption rate is only part of the table, since the geographical clustering of non-medical exemptions can result in a local build-up of a critical mass of vulnerable children that increases the risk of outbreaks."	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	"For example, in the period 2006-2007, the non-medical exemption rate at the state level in Washington was 6%; however, the exemption rate at the county level ranged from 1.2 to 26.9 per cent (Figure 1).25 In a spatial analysis of Michigan exemption data by census area, 23 statistically significant clusters of increased exemptions were identified.26 Similar exemption rates were identified in Oregon27 and California (unpublished data)."	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	"The reasons for the geographic clustering of exemptions from school immunization requirements are not fully understood, but may include characteristics of the local population (e.g., cultural issues, socio-economic status or level of education), beliefs of local health care providers and opinion leaders (e.g., clergy and politicians) and local media coverage."	0

Should vaccination be mandatory	"In Colorado, the incidence of measles and pertussis among immunized children at the county level from 1987 to 1998 was associated with the incidence of exemptions in that county.35 At least 11% of non-exempt children who contracted measles were infected by contact with an exempt child.35 In addition, school outbreaks in Colorado were associated with increased exemption rates; the average exemption rate in schools where outbreaks had occurred was 4.3%, compared with 1.5% in schools that had not experienced an outbreak (P=0.001).35 In Colorado, the incidence of measles and pertussis among immunized children at the county level from 1987 to 1998 was associated with the incidence of exemptions in that county."	0

Should vaccination be mandatory	"Denial of vaccine increases not only the individual risk of disease, but also the risk to the community as a whole."	-1
Should vaccination be mandatory	"As a result of substantial progress in reducing vaccine-preventable diseases, the memory of several infectious diseases fades from public consciousness and the calculation of benefit risks seems to have evolved in favour of perceived risks of vaccination in the minds of some parents."	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	"In the United States, the main reasons for the refusal of vaccine are parental perceptions and concerns about vaccine safety and a low level of concern about the risk of many vaccine-preventable diseases."	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	"In order to preserve the enormous benefits of immunization to society, greater efforts will be required to raise public awareness of these benefits and to increase public confidence in the systems we use to monitor and ensure the safety of vaccines."	0

Does online shopping promote economic development	The reality is a little more complex.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	Online shopping can keep taxes away from the local economy.	-1
Does online shopping promote economic development	Perhaps the biggest negative impact of online sales on the economy is that they reduce the amount of sales tax that the state collects and other local taxes that cities and counties collect.	-1
Does online shopping promote economic development	Not all online retailers charge the appropriate sales tax or other local taxes for items purchased by customers in their online stores.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"As a result, residents of a state may not pay sales taxes on online purchases they would have paid had they made the same purchase in a brick and mortar store."	0

Does online shopping promote economic development	"For example, a local company is likely to charge appropriate taxes for online purchases and fall under Indiana law, which requires some companies to charge sales taxes for online purchases."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"Similarly, when consumers shop online from local businesses, this money continues to enter the local economy."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"Rather than losing money for non-local entities, the local economy still receives money from these online purchases, as these purchases are always made from local businesses."	0

Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Internet Games : Prohibition c. Legalization	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	My testimony today will describe some of the factors that will frustrate attempts to ban gambling on the Internet and force the legalization of its events.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	I will focus on three factors:	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"First, Internet technology makes prohibition futile."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"The inherently open architecture of the Internet already hobbles law enforcement officials, while untiring technological innovation ensures that they will fall further."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Second, as an international network, the Internet offers an instant detour around purely domestic prohibitions."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"The principles of national sovereignty will prevent the United States from forcing other countries to impose a ban on gambling on the Internet, and only one safe port abroad is needed to ensure that American citizens can play on the Internet."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Thirdly, consumer demand for Internet gambling and the demand from states for tax revenues will create enormous political pressure for legalization."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"The law enforcement community, which has benefited until recently from media spotlights, will soon find its calls for a ban drowned by these and other political forces."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Since the difficult and cold facts about the inevitable failure of the ban will undoubtedly depress some decent and well-intentioned people, I will lift my analysis with some comforting words on the Internet game."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	A dispassionate report reveals that Internet gaming offers several advantages:	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Internet gaming will promote network development;	-1
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	It will provide a healthier environment than real world casinos; and	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	It will benefit consumers by increasing competition in gambling services.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Before launching in detail why legalisation will defeat the Internet ban, and why this result should not cause a major alarm, allow me to eliminate a preliminary objection."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Some advocates of a ban on Internet gambling argue that if the ban does not work then or no regulatory system.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(1) However, such an argument does not fundamentally include a fundamental principle of governance: regulations can succeed even if the ban fails if they offer advantages that exceed their burden."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	That's why people don't illegally shoot bullshit in the alleys of Las Vegas.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"In the case of Internet gaming, the advantages of winning an official approval stamp could convince an onlinecasino to comply with the regulations, even if the same casino could easily refuse a total ban on its activities."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	What regulatory measures will the Internet gaming industry tolerate exactly?	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"In all probability, not much, but only practical experience can resolve this issue."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Prohibition of RendersFutile Internet technology	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The very architecture of the Internet makes the ban on futile gambling.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Unlike telephone communications, which usually move on switched networks, Internet communications use packet switching."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Each Internet message is broken in discrete packages, which travel on various and unpredictable routes until it is received and reassembled at the destination of the theme."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"In other words, sending a message on the Internet is a bit like matching with someone by writing a letter, cutting it off, and sending each room separately to the same address."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"The recipient can assemble it, but anyone who snoops on your correspondence has a larger part of it."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Understanding Internet communications as an approach to the postal system clarifies why the ban on gambling will simply not work.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Imagine telling the postal service that it must now suppress all letters transmitting information used in the illegal game.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	She rightly objects that she already has her hands full to deliver the mail and that she does not have the necessary equipment and staff to snoop in every letter.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Furthermore, it cannot always indicate which messages are related to illegal activities."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	People use bets and bets in everyday conversations where players often speak in code.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"In the meantime, courier customers will strongly oppose the postal service through their correspondence."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Nor can prohibitionists expect the postal service to simply stop sending mail from certain addresses associated with illegal gambling.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The postal service will again oppose the implementation of such a programme.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Citizens will again oppose law enforcement spying on private correspondence.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"More importantly, however, trying to cut some addresses will simply fail to stop the game."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The players will be on P.O.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"boxes, which they can change at any time, and simply file outgoing correspondence without a return address."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	All these considerations apply with equal or greater force to gambling on the Internet.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Compared to the postal system, the Internet facilitates the encryption of messages, the change of addresses and the sending and receipt of anonymous messages. Internet service providers would therefore find it impossible to discriminate between illegal information about games and other Internet traffic."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"In addition, unlike the quasi-public and monolithic postal system, the Internet relies on thousands of separate and entirely private service providers to deliver its services."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	All would be blatantly opposed to the burden of banning Internet traffic.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	More than a few would simply refuse to cooperate.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Does that look like a pessimistic account?	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"On the contrary, it simply describes the current situation."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Technological innovation continues to stimulate the development of Internet communications, law enforcement officials will fall far behind illegal players."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Given these technological constraints, the ban on Internet gambling will not work as intended."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"As an unintended side effect, however, the ban would seriously compromise the cost, efficiency and security of Internet communications."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Given the inevitable failure of technicalfixes, the legalisation of gambling on the Internet is the only viable solution."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Internet The game can escape domestic prohibitions	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The ban on Internet gaming in the country will simply push the company abroad.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Federal law enforcement agencies admit that they cannot stop gambling operations abroad.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The international game on the Internet?	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"There's nothing we can do about it, Justice Minister John Russell said:"	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	(2) Even Sén. Jon Kyl admitted that it would be a very difficult activity to regulate because we do not have jurisdiction over the people who do.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	-3	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Both practical and legal barriers prevent any national ban on Internet gambling from having an international effect.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Because the Internet provides instant access to sites that are too many, any national ban on the provision of gaming services will have to cover the entire planet to operate."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"U.S. law enforcement officials can - and have recently made - arrest local citizens accused of running Internet gambling companies, but intelligent operators will quickly learn to move abroad and stay there."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	-4	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Gambling services can find many overseas shelters.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"An increasing number of countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Antigua and Costa Rica, have decided to legalize and license Internet gaming services."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(5) The principles of international law, which protect the sovereignty of each country, prevent the United States from extradited its nationals solely for violating national anti-gambulation laws."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(6) In addition, the Sixth Amendment of the Charter of Rights of the Constitution prohibits criminal proceedings against those who remain abroad in the operation of gambling sites on the Internet."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	7) Law enforcement officials in the United States are therefore unable to arrest or condemn anyone who offers gambling services on the Internet from a safe port abroad.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The powerful demand of InternetGambling	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The Americans love to play.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Having already integrated traditional games of chance, they will almost certainly be a warm welcome to gambling on the Internet."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	At least 56% of Americans played in 1995.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	(8) Few Americans consider it immoral; A 1993 survey revealed that only 25% of non-gambers cited moral or religious reasons.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(9) Current estimates suggest that Americans will be bet more than $600 billion in 1998, or nearly $2,400 for every man, woman and child."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(10) Approximately $100 billion of this money will be spent on illegal bets, demonstrating that the Americans are already paying little attention to anti-gambling laws."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	-11	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Whatever its legality, the Americans have already shown that they support the nascent Internet gaming industry."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Analysts calculate that of the $1 billion revenues generated by the Internet in 1997, approximately $600 million came from the United States."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(12)Online casinos will have global revenues of approximately $7.9 billion by 2001, $3.5 billion from U.S. consumers."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(13) Because the Internet provides beneficiaries with instant access to gambling sites abroad and relative security of pursuit, online gambling will grow independently of what prohibitionists want."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Soon, however, prohibitionists will have more to worry about than consumer demand."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Law enforcement officers seized the media's fire by telling scary stories and demanding new powers to crush gambling on the Internet.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"However, as the futility of the ban becomes increasingly evident, the cooler heads of government revenue services will begin to see the game on the Internet as a huge new cashcow."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"The ban only guarantees that Internet players will ship their money to places like Antigua, New Zealand and Australia."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"The same political forces that have led to the general legalization of the lottery, casino and embossing of river boats will thus lead to the legalization of the Internet gaggling."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Indeed, this trend towards the legalization of gambling on the Internet has already begun."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Initially, Sen. Kyl's Internet Game Prohibition Act, 1997 prohibited all forms of online commercial competition, across the United States, for all participants."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(14) In the face of a storm of objections, he recently drafted an amendment to the bill that would allow a variety of types of online games, such as interstateoff-track bet, intrastate pari-mutual and lottery games."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	(15) Bob Goodlatte once defended his own bill prohibiting Internet gambling by saying that existing laws were turned on their heads over the Internet because [n]oling people must leave the comfort of their home to access casinos.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(16) Indeed, nine states already allow their citizens to access professional games services at home through telecommunications devices."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(17) Legalized Internetgambling, far from revolutionizing American culture, will come as a natural extension of current social and technological trends."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The advantages of InternetGambling	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	I have set out a number of reasons why attempts to ban gambling on the Internet will inevitably fail and give way to legalization.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"However, mere futility is hardly enough to rule out bad public policies."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	So let me explain some reasons why we should welcome the legalization of the game on the Internet.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Internet gaming will encourage the private sector to develop network capacity and commerce.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Just as the casinos of the real world have competed to build the most innovative environments and apps, so the Internet gaming services will compete to offer the most flash graphics and the most sophisticated user interfaces."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"This competition, as a good profit side, will result in a wider bandwidth and better software for all kinds of Internet applications."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Critics of real-world casinos blame them for attracting consumers into windowless caves away from the real world, with gambling traps at every turn and free alcohol."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Regardless of the validity of such criticisms, they certainly do not apply to gambling on the Internet."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"On the contrary, consumers who connect computers at home will find it impossible to escape phone calls, barking dogs and any other distractions in the real world, thus providing a healthier environment than its real-world counterpart."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Finally, we must never forget that players deserve all the benefits that other consumers of entertainment services enjoy, including the benefits of competition."	-1
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"By providing consumers with easy access to a variety of gaming opportunities, the Internet will bring competition to an industry that has long benefited from very restrictive licensing practices."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Players will no longer have to fly to Las Vegas to play slot machines, drive to the nearest authorized track to play horses, or even walk to the corner store to play statelotto."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Consumers can already play these games and others at home via many websites - more than 50 and growing - that offer degambling services.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(18) The ban on gambling on the Internet will not make it inaccessible, while its legalization will put the benefits of increased competition in the rule of law."	0

Should there be a curfew for children?	Five main reasons for abolishing curfews	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	Juvenile curfews are a violation of the fundamental rights of young people.	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	Both the American Constitution and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child affirm that freedom of movement and association is an important right.	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	"Federal courts have also recognized that curfew restrictions violate the rights of the first amendment, such as freedom of expression and assembly, and have therefore cancelled many curfews that do not grant exemptions from freedom of expression."	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	"In addition to the rights arising from the first amendment, curfews violate the fair and equitable treatment provided for by law and the guarantees of substantive and procedural proceedings, making them unconstitutional in other ways."	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	Curfews are ineffective in reducing crime.	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	A recent review of several studies of juvenile curfews revealed that they were ineffective in reducing both crime and victimization.	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	"This allowed earlier consideration of juvenile curfew studies, which also revealed that juvenile delinquency and victimization were most likely to remain unchanged after curfew enforcement and that, when changes were observed, they were as likely to reflect an increase in crime as the decrease."	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	"In fact, some studies show that curfews can lead to an increase in crime."	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	"For example, in the District of Columbia, the number of firearms-related violence incidents increased significantly after extending the curfew by only one hour."	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	The researchers hypothesized that it was because juvenile curfews change the number of witnesses on the street and the way the police spend their time.	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	Juvenile curfews punish non-criminal behaviour.	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	"Curfew violations are a type of status offence, which means that they criminalize behaviour that is illegal only because the person involved is under the age of 18."	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	"Status offences unjustly punish young people for activities that are not considered to be harmful to society (otherwise, it would be illegal for everyone to do so)."	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	They are purely discriminatory and create criminals from law-abiding citizens.	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	"Because curfews increase the likelihood of youth being attracted to the criminal justice system, criminal justice reformers began to speak out against the ""curfew-to-prison"" pipeline."	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	"For example, in Lexington, KY, the curfew violation penalty may be a fine of $499, while the maximum speed penalty is $200."	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	This shows that the city of Lexington considers a young person walking on the streets at night to be a greater threat to public safety than someone who exceeds the speed limit.	0

Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	The authors randomly vary the proportion of landless agricultural workers who migrate to 133 villages in order to generate shocks in the supply of labour of different sizes in different villages.	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	They then use this variation to document the general evolution of wage and price balance since the significant increase in the seasonal migration subsidy project piloted by Mobarak a few years ago.	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	"Indeed, these changes represent the way the project affects villages as a whole when the project is implemented on a large scale, with a large number of simultaneous migrations per village."	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	"First, the authors note that a higher proportion of migrants leaving rural villages during the famine season means that other people in the village were more likely to migrate as well."	0

Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	"Sam Asher presented a new paper, co-written with Paul Novosad, on the impact that new and improved rural roads have on labour market outcomes in villages in India."	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	Rural roads can have a significant impact on villages in that they connect people living there to important urban markets and work opportunities.	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	Roads allow people previously working in agriculture to look for new jobs that are potentially better paid outside their traditional sector.	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	"The authors are therefore examining a comprehensive road construction programme in India that has provided asphalt roads to more than 100,000 villages since 2000 to see how this affects the people living there."	0

Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	"By using this arbitrary population limit in the eligibility of the programme, Asher and Novosad are able to measure the effect of the programme on wages and the evolution of the sectoral composition of work."	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	"The construction of roads to previously unconnected villages results in a 10 percentage point reduction in the share of households and workers in agriculture, with an equivalent increase in participation in the paid labour market."	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	"Roads allow people who used to work in agriculture to look for new, potentially better-paying jobs outside their traditional sector."	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	"This change in sectoral labour allocation is strongest with men and households with low land levels, with the population having the greatest potential to benefit from structural transformation."	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	Reassignment of labour out of agriculture is also the strongest in places close to large cities.	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	The document therefore shows that access to urban markets is crucial to facilitate the process of structural transformation and that insufficient rural transport infrastructure is a major obstacle to sectoral labour allocation in low-income countries.	0

Should we protect endangered animals?	"From Amur Leopards, Black Rhinos and Borne Orangutans to Hawksbill Turtles, Vaquitas and Bluefin tuna, many endangered animals are threatened."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	This means that we risk losing these animals completely.	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"We have devoted a great deal of time, effort and money to saving endangered animals, but why?"	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	Extinction is a natural process that would occur with or without humans.	-1
Should we protect endangered animals?	"But, although this is the case, research shows that extinctions occur faster than ever before."	1

Should we protect endangered animals?	Studies have shown that uncontrolled deforestation and extinction of species will have a direct impact on human well-being.	1
Should we protect endangered animals?	"Even little-known species can bring surprising benefits to humans, such as drugs that fight cancer."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"The benefits of species protection may not be immediately apparent, but the many ecosystem services provided by many animals and ecosystems make wildlife conservation worth time and money."	1
Should we protect endangered animals?	"In the 1990s, Indian researchers began to notice something strange in the sky."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"The vultures of the South Asian Gypsies, which had several million inhabitants, died quickly."	0

Should we protect endangered animals?	"The cause of their death was a veterinary medicine called diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug commonly administered to livestock."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"Once the cattle died, the vultures fed on their carcasses and, as a result, died of kidney failure."	0

Should we protect endangered animals?	Some of us may even think that it is our moral obligation to protect all living creatures.	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	But is it really logical to save all species moving towards extinction?	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"After all, saving endangered species is expensive."	-1
Should we protect endangered animals?	A study published in 2012 in Science estimated that it would cost more than $65 billion per year to protect birds around the world.	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	Protection of other lands and other aquatic animals and plants would be much more expensive.	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"But extinctions are natural, as can be seen from countless species known only from fossils and museum specimens."	1
Should we protect endangered animals?	"In fact, the last five massive extinctions, occurring over an average cycle of 26 million years, have wiped out entire families of animals and plants, including dinosaurs."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	The loss of life has radically changed the course of life on our planet.	0

Should we protect endangered animals?	"Money could be better spent to alleviate poverty, hunger and disease all over the world."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	But human problems and extinction of species are not mutually exclusive.	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	Studies have shown that uncontrolled deforestation and extinction of species can have a direct impact on human well-being.	1
Should we protect endangered animals?	One example is the disappearance of Gypsy vultures and the resulting spread of infectious diseases in India.	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	The spread of other diseases such as the deadly Ebola virus has also been linked to forest clearing and bush meat hunting.	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"In addition, scientists have found increasing evidence linking loss of species diversity in ecosystems to increased disease transmission and incidence in humans."	1
Should we protect endangered animals?	"For example, a 2010 review study published in Nature found a strong link between the low diversity of birds in the United States and an increased risk of West Nile encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus, in humans."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	Many species even act as indicators of environmental health.	1
Should we protect endangered animals?	Their decline may indicate that there is something wrong with the region where they — and humans — live.	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"One of the most famous examples is how the decline of bald eagles in North America exposed environmental contamination to DDT, a pesticide used to control mosquitoes and other insects."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	Threatened species can also have economic value for local communities that share their homes with animals and plants.	1
Should we protect endangered animals?	"Protected areas for charismatic species such as tigers and gorillas, for example, can attract significant tourism."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"In some protected areas designed to conserve endangered wildlife species, governments and conservation organizations have developed strategies that also improve the lives of local communities."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"According to a 2006 report by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the increase in tourism in wildlife parks managed by Namibian communities has led to higher salaries for local communities and higher profits for community businesses."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"In some cases, conservation organizations also support rural infrastructure around protected areas, creating health care centres, schools and drinking water systems."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"However, the answer to the question of whether protected areas really reduce poverty in local societies is still unclear and complicated, and requires a more rigorous assessment."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	But not all animals in danger are charismatic.	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	The conservation of attractive animals such as tigers could later protect their less well-known prey and other animals and plants that share their protected habitats.	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"However, protected areas that focus solely on charismatic species could undermine the chances of unknown, more atrocious or more ordinary species living outside these areas."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	But little-known species can have surprising benefits for humans.	1
Should we protect endangered animals?	"The pharmaceutical industry, for example, owes much of its medicines to the discovery of natural components in nature."	0

Should we protect endangered animals?	"As the U.S. FWS notes, the biochemistry of unexamined species is a non-fathomed reservoir of new and potentially more effective substances."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	But the discovery of such nature rescue compounds can be a double-edged sword.	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"Although it can stimulate the protection of species that produce these compounds, it can also lead to overexploitation."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"The Himalayan ifier (Taxus contorta), for example, is on the verge of extinction due to overharvest for medicinal use and fuel collection."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	The cash value of nature	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"Many endangered species do not necessarily make compounds directly useful to us, or are charismatic enough to attract tourists."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	Does it have an economic meaning to protect them?	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"To answer this question, scientists have tried to know what nature is worth."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"Their monetary valuation of species goes beyond the value of wood, land or tourism, which are relatively easier to measure."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"Instead, scientists have tried to estimate the economic value of ecosystem services: the services nature provides to human communities, such as insect pollination and mangrove flood mitigation."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"In 2010, Nicholas Calderone of Cornell University discovered that bees and other insects pollinated nearly $30 billion in crops in the United States such as apples, almonds, cherries, oranges, asparagus, broccoli, carrots and onions."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	This is how the cultivation of almonds in California requires about 1.7 million hives.	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"Thus, bees and insects reduce the cost of pollination and bring good healthy food to our plates."	0
Should we protect endangered animals?	"However, the world's domestic bee population is facing dramatic declines across the United States, Europe and parts of Asia due to a number of reasons ranging from pesticides to parasites."	0

Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	Why should citizens buy from their own country?	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	Discussion:	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	The different advantages of local purchasing are explained as follows and with examples.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	The first fundamental principle under the impulse to buy locally is that money remains in the same country.	1
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	This concept ensures that the money that has been used for consumer purchases within a country turns into it.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	This money can be used in other developments by the government or it can filter down to other consumers who will also use it.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"If the money had been used and went to another country, a vacuum will ensue that will allow it to take citizens who produce more or who are looking for buyers from outside the country (Cato 99)."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"It is common that when people buy locally, the price of products decreases."	1
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	This concept stems from the fact that locally produced goods do not require specialized processing and packaging.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	These in turn if done increases the cost of a product remarkably as well as the transport of the product made.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"Finally, a locally produced and consumed product becomes cheaper than those from outside the country."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"Ultimately, all consumers benefit from low prices and the country if it increases production achieves economic growth."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"Given that manufacturers and producers of goods and services are in fact employers, this means that if their products are purchased locally, they make more profits."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"Ultimately, these benefits will be paid to employees working in these factories and their standard of living will improve as their wages and salaries increase."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	Both the employer and the employee achieve stability over time as losses are reduced and businesses follow a path of growth.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"On the other hand, the government has its share when consumers choose to buy locally produced products."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"As more and more of these products are created, the company is growing and, in turn, taxes are handed over to the government."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"In addition, as wages and salaries increase, the taxes they pay to the government increase and the government therefore makes more revenue."	1
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"In countries, especially those seeking industrialization to promote local purchasing, they are in fact a basis for economic growth."	1
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	The principle of local purchasing is also followed by savings and local investment.	1
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	This comes from the aspect of local businessmen who invest their profits in other businesses and who also help the government launch interesting projects such as schools and local organizations.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"What this concept ultimately achieves in terms of development in all regions of the country, regardless of the context of the population in this field."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"If people or consumers had brought that money to another country, they would be deprived of such developments."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"Local purchases, as we have already seen, reduce the price of products, leaving a surplus of unused money in consumers' pockets."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	It is this money that people will tend to save for their future businesses.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	Local purchasing ensures savings and the culture of savings is very vital for all citizens.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"Not only is savings limited to money, but also time."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"The amount of time that would have taken a person to go to another place to make purchases is spent on other issues as he or she got what he or she needed in a nearby place (Local Purchase Advantages, Web)."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"In recent times, calls have been made to reduce pollution, accompanied by increased production of goods and services."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"Studies have shown that many processes such as packaging and product preparation increase environmental pollution, whether in air, water or soil."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"When the product is manufactured and consumed locally without unnecessary packaging or processing, environmental pollution is remarkably reduced."	1
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	It is very common that there are people in a certain manufacturing plant to deal with the problems that consumers can raise.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	Customer service plays an important role in ensuring that end-users of a product get all product information at all times and on demand.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"In local production, however, this process becomes easier because information can be obtained instantly and from people you know and can trust."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"In the event of a problem, it can be treated as instantly as possible, contrary to what happens when you have to rely on customer service from a very remote location like another country."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"As has already been said, local manufacturing and consumption do not require long-term freight transport, it becomes clear that wear and tear is considerably reduced."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	Some goods are so sensitive that subjecting them to long-distance travel will only reduce their quality and service life.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"If these distances are local, the products that reach the consumer will have an excellent quality since they have not travelled long distances."	1
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"A good example is that of perishable fruits and vegetables which, if transported to another country, require a great deal of processing and careful handling during transport."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	Local production and consumption therefore imply the freshness and best of these perishable products (Holthaus 248).	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"To the extent that we have seen the many benefits of local production and consumption, a country may sometimes need products from elsewhere to fill any gaps that may arise."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"This should not, however, be done in such a way as to discourage local procurement."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	A disputed fact that accompanies those who argue against local purchasing is the quality of the products.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	It is a common scenario to see products from other countries enter and be even cheaper than those produced locally.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	People may also prefer them to those in their area.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"Since this is a widespread problem facing developing countries, it is nevertheless possible to remedy this problem by encouraging quality local production."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"These countries may not have the capacity to produce all their demands, but in the rare cases where they manage to do so, they must be encouraged."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	Governments in these countries also need to develop a policy that oversees a certain percentage of consumption being limited to locally produced goods.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	Recommendations and Conclusion:	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	Economic globalization fosters greater economic interdependence among countries.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"This is particularly true in the areas of trade through the cross-border exchange of goods and services, capital and technology."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"This concept has seen countries share their products with each other and if a country fails to control itself properly, it may not realize the negative aspect."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"Such a system could slow down local production, as goods and services could flood another country's market."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"By adopting a severe measure such as protectionism, a country can be protected from external competition and therefore the local market will develop."	1
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	Protectionism consists in limiting trade between countries by introducing measures such as import tariffs so that the phenomenon is discouraged.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"Under anti-dumping legislation, cheaper foreign goods that may lead to the disintegration of local businesses are discouraged."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"In conclusion, the economic structure of a certain country is very important."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	This is the basis on which all the other livelihood factors of a citizen of a country are based.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"This means that a country's economy must grow, not fall or stagnate."	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	"Indeed, it will be difficult to maintain productivity growth in recent decades, he says, let alone increase it considerably."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"As the world needs to produce 70% more of almost all the earth's products — crops, herbs and wood — by 2050, there is no additional space for bioenergy, and any capacity to increase crop yields and better use under-used land is already needed for these other purposes, Mr. Searchinger said."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"Professor Faaij says skeptics are wrong, arguing that alternatives to a huge increase in biofuel production would be even more difficult to achieve."	0

Should we ban human cloning	Complete status would accord the embryo the same level of moral duties as you or I.	0
Should we ban human cloning	The statusless position would not give the embryo more status or dignity than your hair or nails.	0
Should we ban human cloning	The position of limited status would accord the embryo a fixed or graduated level of intrinsic moral value between these two extremes.	0
Should we ban human cloning	Full status will require NRC's prohibition (the destructive use of embryos is considered murder) and lack of status will usually require NRC's authorization (unless such an approach harms the moral interests of those who matter).	0
Should we ban human cloning	"However, the limited position is potentially compatible with either regulatory position, depending on the particular status of the early embryo and the weight given to the potential benefits of NRC."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"As a result, the fact that the regulatory position allows or prohibits NRC does not even tell us what the status of the embryo is."	0
Should we ban human cloning	This is even more complicated by the fact that supporters of the non- or limited status position may be willing to accept more restrictions than strictly required by their position in order to protect a larger moral objective.	0
Should we ban human cloning	Only the supporters of the position of full status cannot make pragmatic compromises in a coherent manner [18].	0
Should we ban human cloning	"Similarly, existing positions on the RC could be supported by radically different ethical opinions."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"Prohibitions could be supported by those who consider the RC to be absolutely bad (e.g., always infringing human dignity) and by those who consider that cloning at the present time would be false."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"Even a time-limited ban does not allow us to determine whether it is based, for example, on the opinion that RC is wrong because of current security problems or on the opinion that RC is not wrong, but the most effective way to achieve this is first to prohibit this prohibition."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"In summary, the majority of regulatory outcomes could be explained consistently by reference to one or more underlying ethical positions."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"Thus, similar, if not identical, regulatory outcomes involve fewer ethical agreements than some might be inclined to believe."	0
Should we ban human cloning	Cloning laws and policies are far from uniform throughout the world and the legal situation in some countries remains uncertain.	0
Should we ban human cloning	This will provide little comfort to scientists and decision-makers who hope to obtain a clear direction from the international position.	0
Should we ban human cloning	"At least at this time, policy makers must accept the reality of the international process, and scientists who wish to undertake research on NRC are better advised to consider conducting their research in only a handful of countries."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"Even when there is agreement on the regulatory outcome, decision-makers should not confuse this outcome with agreement on the underlying ethical principles."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"Like many topics relating to the development of genetic and reproductive technologies, cloning remains controversial."	0

Should you stay away from online dating	"Last week, maybe the coldest night I've experienced since I left a university town more or less at the bottom of a lake, The Verge. Ashley Carman and I took the train to Hunter College to watch a debate."	0
Should you stay away from online dating	"The contested proposal was whether the dating apps killed romance, and the host was an adult man who had never used an app dating."	0
Should you stay away from online dating	"By reading the static electricity from my sweater and rubbing a piece of dead skin from my lip, I settled in the 1970s auditorium chair in a mood of 100 percent bad mood, with an attitude of ""Why are we still talking about that?"" I thought to write about it, title: ""Why are we still talking about that?"" (We went because we have a podcast on the apps, and because every RSVP email feels so easy when Tuesday night in question is still six weeks away.)"	0
Should you stay away from online dating	"Fortunately, the party argued that the proposal was true — Note to Selfs Manoush Zomorodi and Aziz Ansari-S Modern Romance co-author Eric Klinenberg — provided only anecdotal evidence on the wrong dates and average boys (and their personal, happy, IRL marriages)."	0
Should you stay away from online dating	The party claiming that this was wrong — Match.com's Chief Science Advisor Helen Fisher and OkCupid Vice President of Engineering Tom Jacques — provided difficult data.	0

Should you stay away from online dating	"While the possibilities seem exciting at first, the effort, attention, patience and resilience it requires can leave people frustrated and exhausted."	1
Should you stay away from online dating	"This experience, and the experience described by Johnston — the gargantuan effort of reducing thousands of people to a pool of perhaps eight — are indeed examples of what Helen Fisher recognized as the fundamental challenge of meeting applications in this debate that Ashley and I so much attended."	0

Should you stay away from online dating	"The dating applications may be a neurotic disorder site for some groups of young people who do not think they need so many options, but it opens up possibilities for romance for people who are often denied the same opportunities to find it in physical spaces — the elderly, the disabled, the isolated."	-1

Should you stay away from online dating	"The essential thing is that romantic love is a mechanism of survival, with its circuits below the cortex, next to the one who orchestrates thirst and hunger."	0
Should you stay away from online dating	"Technology cannot change the fundamental structure of the romance brain, she said, technology changes the way we run. She described it as a shift to weak love, with dating taking on a new meaning, and the pre-engagement phase being traced, giving young people even more time for romance today."	0
Should you stay away from online dating	"At that time, it was disputed if she had even adequately defined what romance is — starting another circular conversation about whether matches are romantic and romantic dates and dates means marriage or sex or a good afternoon."	0
Should you stay away from online dating	I would say that at least 10% of the spectators were deeply stupid or serious trolls.	0
Should you stay away from online dating	"But in the midst of all this talk, it was obvious that the fundamental problem of dating applications is the fundamental problem of any technological innovation: cultural mismatch."	0
Should you stay away from online dating	"We haven't had these tools long enough to have a clear idea of how we're supposed to use them — what people consider, what's good, what's logical, what's cruel."	0
Should you stay away from online dating	"An hour and 40 minutes of scanning to find a person to go on an appointment with is really not so dreadful, compared to the idea of standing around a few different bars for four hours and not finding anyone worth talking about."	0
Should you stay away from online dating	"At the same time, we know what we expected from a face-to-face conversation, and we know much less about what we're supposed to do with a contextless baseball card in a messaging wire that you need to actively remember to look at — at work, when you're connected to WiFi."	0
Should you stay away from online dating	"Although they have lost much of their stigma, dating applications have acquired a transitional set of contradictory cultural connotations and erroneous norms that border dark comedy."	0
Should you stay away from online dating	"Last month, I started making a Spotify playlist composed of boys' choices for the ""My Anthem"" field on Tinder, and I wondered if it would be immoral to show it to anyone — the self-presentation stripped of its context, pushed to be just art, but with a header that twisted it into a sick joke."	0
Should you stay away from online dating	"Then one of my friends texted me on Valentine's Day to say that he had deleted all of his dating apps — he had been tired of notifications coming up in front of the person he was going out, and it seemed like the health option."	0
Should you stay away from online dating	"You could just turn off the notifications, I thought, but what I said was Wow!"	0
Should you stay away from online dating	"Because, uh, what do I know about how someone should behave?"	0

Should you stay away from online dating	"I certainly wouldn't want to make the argument that dating apps are always enjoyable, or that an application of encounters has helped to find eternal love for every person who has ever sought it, but it's time to stop throwing anecdotal evidence at a debate that has already ended with numbers."	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	The paradigm shift of AI for robot programming	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Artificial intelligence changes the way robots are programmed.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Abbeel and his Embruntated Intelligence team are harnessing the power of AI to help industrial robots acquire new complex skills.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Their work evolved from the search for co-founders at UC Berkeley where they had a major breakthrough in using imitation learning and deep reinforcement learning to teach robots to manipulate objects.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"This video, courtesy of UC Berkeley, demonstrates the state-of-the-art laboratory technology that led to spin-off."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	The startup uses a combination of detection and control to teleoperate a robot.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"For detection, an operator wears a virtual reality helmet that shows the view of the robot through its camera."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"On the control side, VR devices such as Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are delivered with portable devices that the operator holds in his hands."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"As the operator moves his hands, this movement is followed."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	The coordinates and orientation are transmitted to a computer that drives the robot.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"This is how the operator directly controls, like a puppeteer, the movements of robotic clamps."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"We allow the human to integrate inside the robot, says Abbeel."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	So now the man can see through the robot's eyes and control the robot's hands.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	He says humans are so dexterious that there is no comparison between robot clamps and our hands.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"By working through the VR system, the operator is forced to follow the constraints of the robot."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"You teach the essence of robot skill by giving demonstrations, says Abbeel."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	That doesn't mean he'll be robotically fast at that time.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"He will do it at the human rhythm, which is slow for most robots."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	This is the first phase (learning imitation).	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	You teach the robot through demonstrations.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Then in the second phase, the robot will perform the reinforcement learning, where it learns from its own trial and error, Abbeel continues."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	The beauty here is that the robot has already learned the essence of the task.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Now, the robot just has to learn how to speed it up."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	This is something he can learn relatively quickly by strengthening learning.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"The operator who wears a virtual reality helmet and holds motion tracking devices telelocates a robot, showing him how to capture and manipulate objects so that he can finally learn to perform new skills by himself using the learning of reinforcement."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	(Photo courtesy of Intelligence Borrowed)Abbeel says their technology is particularly suited to difficult vision and manipulation tasks that are currently too complex for traditional software programming techniques.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Applications include working with deformable objects that change shape during handling such as wires, cables and textiles."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Bin picking is another potential application.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	On-board intelligence raised $7 million in seed capital last fall.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Abbeel says they have been in talks with more than 100 companies to understand their needs and determine if there is a good fit for the technology, noting that the software is agnostic to the type of robot."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"We reproduce their installation at our office, then we start collecting demonstrations and writing the code so that the robot can learn from these demonstrations, says Abbeel."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Then we coordinate with the partner company to ensure that we teach the robot to their specifications.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"He states that the types of partner companies include car, electronic or clothing manufacturers, contract manufacturers, warehouse and logistics operations, and pharmaceutical, agricultural and construction companies."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"We are changing the way robots are programmed, says Abbeel."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	We write the code for imitation learning and write the code for reinforcement learning.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Once this code is in place, when you want a new deployment, we do not write a new code."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Instead, we collect new data."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Thus, the paradigm shifts from the development of new software for a new deployment to the new data collection for a new deployment."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Data collection is generally easier.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	It's a lower bar than the new software engineering.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Finally, embedded intelligence will allow other people to use this software to reprogram their robots by doing their own demonstrations."	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Enter cloud robotics, a vital engine for today's AI-powered robots."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Cloud robotics allows the sharing of information so that intelligence, essentially acquired skills, can be shared collectively among all robots in a connected environment."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"It also allows collaboration so that two or more remote robots, or teams of human robots, can work together to carry out a task, even if miles separate."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"As more and more AI-powered robots enter the market, they will need to be connected to a common platform."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"CloudMinds Technology, a new start-up founded in 2015, wants to be this common platform, identifying itself as the world's leading cloud robot operator."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Robert Zhang says AI-powered robots will need the cloud to make them smarter and more capable.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"(Photo courtesy of CloudMinds Technology)The reason we wanted to create CloudMinds is because we think this is an opportunity to apply our telecommunications experience to robotics and AI, says Robert Zhang, co-founder and president."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	We want to be robot operators.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Zhang, a PhD in computer mechanics, comes from mass electronics giants such as Samsung, Microsoft and Apple."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"His co-founder, serial entrepreneur and CEO Bill Huang, was previously the Managing Director of the China Mobile Research Institute where he led the development of the first Android carrier project, among others."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"CloudMinds has attracted leading investors, including SoftBank and FoxConn."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"The startup will provide a cloud platform and related services to companies that design and sell robot hardware, just as a mobile network operator provides wireless communications services to its customers."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"While Zhang says their platform will also work well for industrial robots and consumer robots, they focus on making consumer robots smarter."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"For a robot to perform tasks in the home environment, the required AI is very powerful, says Zhang."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"For a robot to prepare a meal or fold your laundry, these are very unstructured tasks."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	You can't really put AI's ability on the robot.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"This is impossible from a commercial point of view, because there are so many different tasks."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	That's why AI should come from the cloud.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Whatever the robot is originally designed for, you can always have the cloud to make the robot more capable and smarter, he adds."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	We're still a few years away from the Rosie Jetsons.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Yet some of the AI-powered technologies that can be an integral part of a household robot, such as computer vision, handling capabilities, speech recognition, mapping and navigation, have already emerged from the laboratory in the real world."	0
