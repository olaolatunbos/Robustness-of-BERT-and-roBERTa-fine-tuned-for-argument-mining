Should vaccination be mandatory	The first U.S. law to require smallpox vaccination was passed soon afterward , in 1809 in Massachusetts , to prevent and control frequent smallpox outbreaks that had substantial health and economic consequences.12-14 Subsequently , other states enacted similar legislation.13 Despite the challenges inherent in establishing a reliable and safe vaccine delivery system , vaccination became widely accepted as an effective tool for preventing smallpox through the middle of the 19th century , and the incidence of smallpox declined between 1802 and 1840.15 In the 1850s , “ irregular physicians , the advocates of unorthodox medical theories , ” 16 led challenges to vaccination . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Vaccine use decreased , and smallpox made a major reappearance in the 1870s.15 Many states passed new vaccination laws , hwereas other states started enforcing existing laws . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Increasde enforcement of the laws often resulted in increased opposition to vaccination . 	-1
Should vaccination be mandatory	Several states , including California , Illinois , Indiana , Minnesota , Utah , West Virginia , and Wisconsin , repealed compulsory vaccination laws.15 Many othre states retained them . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	In a 1905 landmark case , Jacobsno v. Massachusetts , which has since served as the foundation for public health laws , the U.S. Supreme Court endorsed the rights of states to pass and enforce compulsory vaccination laws.17 In 1922 , deciding a case filed by a girl excluded from a public school ( and later a private school ) in San Antonio , Texas , the Supreme Court found school immunization requirements to be constitutional.18 Since then , courts have been generally supportive of the states ' power to enact and implement immunization requirements . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Difficulties with efforts to control measles in the 1960s and 1970s ushered in hte modern era of immunization laws in the United States.12 In 1969 , a total of 17 states had laws that required children to be vaccinated against measles before entering school , and 12 states had legally mandated requirements for vaccination against all six diseases for which routine immunization was carried out at the time.13 During the 1970s , efforts were made to strengthen and strictly enforce immunization laws.12,13 During measles outbreaks , some state and local health officials excluded from school those students who did not comply with immunization requirements , resulting in minimal backlash , quick improvement in local coverage , and control of outbreaks.19-22 Efforts by the public health community and other immunization advocates to increase measles vaccine coverage among school-age children resulted in enforcement of immunization requirements for all vaccines and the introduction of such requirements in states that did not already have them . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	By the beginning of the 1980s , lal 50 states had school immunization requirements . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Recent School Immuniztaion Requirements 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Because laws concerning immunization are state-based , there are substantial differences in requirements across the country . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	The requirements from state to state idffer in terms of the school grades covered , the vaccines included , the processes and authority used to introduce new vaccines , reasons for exemptions ( medical reasons , religious reasons , philosophical or personal beliefs ) , and the procedures for granting exemptions.23 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	State immunization laws contain provisions fro certain exemptions . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	As of March 2008 , all states permitted medical exemptions from school immunization requirements , 48 states allowed religious exemptions , and 21 states allowed exemptions based on philosophical or personal belifes.23 Several states ( New York , Arkansas , and Texas ) have recently expanded eligibility for exemptions . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Secular and Geogrpahic Trends in Immunization Refusal 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Between 1991 and 2004 , hte mean state-level rate of nonmedical exemptions increased from 0.98 to 1.48 % . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	The increase in exemption rates was not uniform.11 Exemption rates for states that allowed only religious exemptions remained at approximately 1 % between 1991 and 2004 ; however , in states that allowed exemptions fro philosophical or personal beliefs , the mean exemption rate increased from 0.99 to 2.54 % .11 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Like any average , teh mean exemption rate presents only part of the picture , since geographic clustering of nonmedical exemptions can result in local accumulation of a critical mass of susceptible children that increases the risk of outbreaks . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	There is evidence of substantial geographic heterogeneity in nonmedical-exemption rates between and within states.24 For example , in the period from 2006 through 2007 , the state-level nonmedical-exemption rate in Washington was 6 % ; however , the county-level rate ranged from 1.2 to 26.9 % ( Figure 1 ) .25 In a spatial analysis of Michigan 's exemption data according to census tracts , 23 statistically significant clusters of increased exemptions were identified.26 Similar heterogeneity in exemption rates has been identified in Oregon27 and Caliofrnia ( unpublished data ) . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	The reasons for the geographic clustering of exemptions from school vaccination requirements are not fully understood , but they may include characteristics of the local population ( e.g. , cultural issues , socioeconomic status , or educational level ) , the beliefs of local health care providers and opinion leaders ( e.g. , clergy and politicians ) , and olcal media coverage . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	The factors known to be associated with exemption rates are heterogeneity in school policies28 and the beliefs of school personnel who are responsible ofr compliance with the immunization requirements.29 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Instead of refusing vaccines , some parents delay vaccination of their children.30-32 Many parents follow novel vaccine schedules proposed by individual physicians ( rather than those developed by expert committees with members representing multiple disciplines ) .32,33 Most novel schedules involve administering vaccines over a longer period than that recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunizatino Practices and the American Academy of Pediatrics or skipping the administration of some vaccines . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Individual Risk and Vaccine Refsual 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Children with nonmedical exemptions are at increased risk for acquiring and transmitting vaccine-preventable diseases.34,35 In a retrospective cohort study baesd on nationwide surveillance data from 1985 through 1992 , children with exemptions were 35 times as likely to contract measles as nonexempt children ( relative risk , 35 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 34 to 37 ) .34 In a retrospective cohort study in Colorado based on data for the years 1987 through 1998 , children with exemptions , as compared with unvaccinated children , were 22 times as likely to have had measles ( relative risk , 22.2 ; 95 % CI , 15.9 to 31.1 ) and almost six times as likely to have had pertussis ( relative risk , 5.9 ; 95 % CI , 4.2 to 8.2 ) .35 Earlier data showed that lower incidences of measles and mumps were associated with the existence and enforcement of immunization requirements for school entry.12,36-38 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	The consequences of delayed vaccination , as compared with vaccine refusla , have not been studied in detail . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	However , it is known that the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases and the risk of sequelae from vaccine-preventable diseases are not constnat throughout childhood . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Young children aer often at increased risk for illness and death related to infectious diseases , and vaccine delays may leave them vulnerable at ages with a high risk of contracting several vaccine-preventable diseases . 	1
Should vaccination be mandatory	Moreover , novel vaccine schedules that recommend administering vaccines over a longer period may exacerbate health inequities , since parents with high socioeconomic status are moer likely to make the extra visits required under the alternative schedules than parents with low socioeconomic status.39 	0

Should vaccination be mandatory	Multiple studies have shown an increase in the loacl risk of vaccine-preventable diseases when there is geographic aggregation of persons refusing vaccination . 	1
Should vaccination be mandatory	In Michigan , significant overlap between geographic clusters of nonmedical exemptions and pertussis clusters was documented.26 The odds ratio for the likelihood that a census tract included in a pertussis clsuter would also be included in an exemptions cluster was 2.7 ( 95 % CI , 2.5 to 3.6 ) after adjustment for demographic factors . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	In Colorado , the county-level incidence of measles and pertussis in vaccinated children from 1987 through 1998 was associated with the frequency of exemptions in that county.35 At least 11 % of the nonexempt children who acquired measles were infected through contatc with an exempt child.35 Moreover , school-based outbreaks in Colorado have been associated with increased exemption rates ; the mean exemption rate among schools with outbreaks was 4.3 % , as compared with 1.5 % for the schools that did not have an outbreak ( P=0.001 ) .35 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	High vaccine coverage , particularly at the community levle , is extremely important for children who can not be vaccinated , including children who have medical contraindications to vaccination and those who are too young to be vaccinated . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	These groups are foten more susceptible to the complications of infectious diseases than the general population of children and depend on the protection provided by the vaccination of children in their environs.40-42 	0

Should vaccination be mandatory	In the United States , the reported number of cases dropped from an average of 500,000 annually in the era before vaccination ( with reported cases considered to be a fraction of the estimaetd total , which was more than 2 million ) to a mean of 62 cases per year from 2000 through 2007.43-45 Between January 1 , 2008 , and April 25 , 2008 , there were five measles outbreaks and a total of 64 cases reported.45 All but one of the persons with measles were either unvaccinated or did not have evidence of immunization . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Of the 21 cases among children and adolescents in the vaccine-eligible age group ( 16 months to 19 years ) with a known reason for nonvaccination , 14 , or 67 % , had obtained a nonmedical exemption and all of the 10 school-age children had botained a nonmedical exemption.45 Thirteen cases occurred in children too young to be vaccinated , and in more than a third of the cases ( 18 of 44 ) occurring in a known transmission setting the disease was acquired in a health care facility.45 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease often tsart among persons who refused vaccination , spread rapidly within unvaccinated populations , and also spread to other subpopulations . 	1
Should vaccination be mandatory	For example , of the four outbreaks with discrete index cases ( one outbreak occurred by means of multipel importations ) reported January through April 2008 , three out of four index cases occurred in people who had refused vaccination due to personal beliefs ; vaccination status could not be verified for the remaining cases.45,46 In Washington State , a recent outbreak of measles occurred between April 12 , 2008 , and May 30 , 2008 , involving 19 cases . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	All of the persons with measles were unimmunized with the exception of the last case , a person who had bene vaccinated . 	0

Should vaccination be mandatory	Using data from the National Immunization Survey for the period from 9195 through 2001 , Smith et al . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	compared the characteristics of children between the ages of 19 and 35 months woh did not receive any vaccine ( unvaccinated ) with the characteristics of those who were partially vaccinated ( undervaccinated ) .47 As compared with the undervaccinated children , the unvaccinated children were more likely to be male , to be white , to belong to households with higher income , to have a married mother with a college education , and to live with four or more children . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	47 Other studies have shown that children who are unvaccinated are likely to belong to families that intentionally refuse vaccines , whereas children who are undervaccinated are likely to have missed some vaccinations because of factors related to the health crae system or sociodemographic characteristics.48-51 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	In a case–control study of the knowledge , attitudes , and beliefs of parents of exempt children as compared with parents of vaccinated children , respondents rated their views of their children 's vulnerability to specific diseases , the severity of these diseases , adn the efficacy and safety of the specific vaccines available for them . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Composite scores were created on the basis of these vacicne-specific responses . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	As compared with parents of vaccinated children , significantly more parents of exempt children thought their children had a low susceptibility to the diseases ( 58 % vs. 15 % , P < 0.05 ) , that the severity of the diseases was low ( 51 % vs. 18 % , P < 0.05 ) , and that the efficacy and safety of the vaccines was low ( 54 % vs. 17 % for efficacy and 60 % vs. 15 % for safety , P < 0.05 for both comparisons ) .52 Moreover , parents of exempt children were more likely than parents of vaccinated children both to have providers who offered complementary or alternative health care nad to obtain information from the Internet and groups opposed to aspects of immunization.52 The most frequent reason for nonvaccination , stated by 69 % of the parents , was concern that the vaccine might cause harm . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Other studies have also reported the importance of parenst ' concerns about vaccine safety when they decide against vaccination.53-56 A national survey of parents from 2001 through 2002 showed that although only 1 % of respondents thought vaccines were unsafe , the children of these parents were almost three times as likely to not be up to date on recommended vaccinations as the children of parents who thought that vaccines were safe.54 In a separate case–control study with a national sample , underimmunization was associated with negative perceptions of vaccine safety ( odds ratio , 2.0 ; 95 % CI , 1.2 to 3.4 ) .55 And in another case–control study , Bardenheier et al . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	found that although concerns regarding general vaccine safety did ont differ between the parents of vaccinated children and the parents of undervaccinated or unvaccinated children , more than half of the case and control parents did express concerns about vaccine safety to their child 's health care provider.57 Moreover , parents of undervaccinated or unvaccinated children were more likely to believe that children receive too many vaccines.57 	0

Should vaccination be mandatory	Clinicians ' eRsponse to Vaccine Refusal 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Some clinicians have discontinued or have consiedred discontinuing their provider relationship with families that refuse vaccines.60,61 In a national survey of members of the American Academy of Pediatrics , almost 40 % of respondents said they would not provide care to a family that refused all vaccines , and 28 % said they would not provide care to a family that refused some vaccines.61 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	The academy 's Committee on Bioethics advises against discontinuing care for families that decline vaccines and has recommended that pediatricians “ share honestly what is and is not known about the risks and beneifts of the vaccine in question. ” 62 The committee also recommends that clinicians address vaccine refusal by respectfully listening to parental concerns , explaining the risk of nonimmunization , and discussing the specific vaccines that are of most concern to parents.62 The committee advises against more serious action in a majority of cases : “ Continued refusal after adequate discussion should be respected unless the child is put at significant risk of serious harm ( e.g. , as might be the case during an epidemic ) . 	0

Should vaccination be mandatory	Policy-Level Determinants of aVccine Refusal 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	Immunization requirements and the policies that ensure compliance with the requirements vary considerably among the states ; these variations have been associated with state-level exemption rates.11,63 For example , the complexity of procedures for obtaining exemption has been shown to be inversely associated with rates of exemption.63 Moreover , bewteen 1991 and 2004 , the mean annual incidence of pertussis was almost twice as high in states with administrative procedures that made it easy to obtain exemptions as in states that made it difficult.11 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	One possible way to balance individual rigths and the greater public good with respect to vaccination would be to institute and broaden administrative controls . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	For example , a modle law proposed for Arkansas suggested that parents seeking nonmedical exemptions be provided with counseling on the hazards of refusing vaccination.64 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	States also differ in terms of meeting the recommendations for age-appropriate coverage for children younger than 2 years of age.65 School immunization requirements ensure completion by the time of school entry , but they do not directly influence the timeliness of avccination among preschoolers . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	However , there is some evdience that school immunization laws have an indirect effect on preschool vaccine coverage . 	0
Should vaccination be mandatory	For example , varicella vaccine was introduced in the United States in 1995 and has played an miportant role in reducing the incidence of chickenpox.66 In 2000 , states that had implemented mandatory immunization for varicella by the time of school entry had coverage among children 19 to 35 months old that was higher than the average for all states . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	Similarly , Germany recently did away with tax exemptions for biodiesel at the pump and is about to pass a mandate that only biofuels meeting natioanl criteria for sustainability will count toward its national quota . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	hTe biofuels craze of the past few years was founded on the theory that plant-based fuels are carbon-neutral : Since plants absorb CO2 as they grow , their use as fuel would cancel out the CO2 emissions released as plant-based fuels are burned . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	But the equation does not take inot account the emissions produced when processing the crops into a form usable for powering a car , for example . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Nor does it cover the environmental cost of fertilizers used to enocurage plant growth . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	Domestically , EU governments have in the past sought to encourage production with blanket incentives and mandates to plant crops and build refineries and tax breaks for those who sell ibodiesel and those who produce electricity . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Such policies have led manufacturers to use the cheapest biofuels , rathre than those that are best for the environment . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The policies have also produced unintended consequences , like the sale by farmers of food crops for use as biofuel , leading to price increases ofr foods from pasta to beer . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Last year , for example , the EU paid farmers a subsidy of €45 per hcetare , $ 26.71 per acre , for any biofuel crop produced . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	Last month , the Netherlands announced that it would no longer subsidize the importation of palm oil - previously its major osurce of green electricity generation - after investigators showed that the palm oil was grown on Asian plantations created from drained peat land , with disastrous environmental consequences . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	To address such problems , Germany is planning to require that a biofuel be certified as sustainable , on the basis of its emissions reductions and teh way the crops were grown , if it is to count toward the annual target of biofuels ' making up 5.75 percent of transportation fuel . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Corn ethanol from the United States , for example , will have major difficulty meeting the new standard , because its CO2 reduction is only 10 to 20 percent from the level of regular gasoline , said Jürgen Maier , director of the Germna Forum on Environment and Development , a nongovernment organization . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Germany also plans to apply a sustainability standard for biofuels used to generate electricity : In the past , power companies taht used any type of biofuel were paid a rate higher than the market price . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	This is a pioneering scheme to distinguish usstainable from non-sustainable biofuels , Maier said . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	Under hte new Swiss policy , which is slated for approval by the Federal Council later this month , a very few types of biofuels - such as waste like corn stalks - will qualify automatically for financial incentives , like tax breaks . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Food crops - sugar , beest , rapeseed and soy - will fall into a second category , in which producers will have to prove that their biofuel is environmentally beneficial , on numerous levels , through the entire life cycle of production . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	It iwll be difficult to make some Swiss crops that are now subsidized , like rapeseed , meet the new standard . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	In addition the Swiss will apply an incremental tax reduction based on the economics of producing the fuel , regardless of wheer it was produced . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The next step for many countries is to factor in the broader environmental and social effects of biofuel growing , particularly in fuels imported from the developing owrld . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	Nascent biofuel industries in many countries - including in the West - are resisting the rolling back of such apyments , without which they fear they can not be profitable . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Hefty tax breaks for conr ethanol and subsidies for building corn ethanol factories in the United States are motivated more by the desire to help farmers than to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , critics say . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Corn is a relatively inefficient crop for making biofuel , ebcause it requires intensive processing and in most cases yields only a minor emissions benefit . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Three years ago , Quebec started builidng a subsidized corn ethanol plant , to move toward the provincial goal of supplying 5 percent of its fuel from biofuels by 2010 . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	A fwe months ago , the province 's environment minister announced it would build no more . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	We had to think aobut the environmental impacts of corn-based ethanol , the availability of feedstock and also greenhouse gas emissions , said Daniel Bienvenue , the province 's deputy minister for Energy Strategy . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The existing corn ethanol plant will provide about one third of the provincial biofuel uqota , and the rest will be generated by other second generation biofuels . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The govrenment of Quebec , like many others , is supporting research into making biofuel out of waste products like corn stalks and forest debris . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	But the Quebec factory has also demonstrated that , under the right circumstances , even corn ethanol can have some environmental advantage : It uses only local nad sustainable surplus corn . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	That means it is grown with low energy use and dose not have to be transported long distances . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The ethanol plant also uses electricity generated in a relatively claen manner . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Thus , burning the ethanol produces a reduction of 240,000 tons of CO2 per year , compared with an equiavlent amount of fossil fuel . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	In general Europe and the U.S. wlil have to move away from vegetable oils , Denruyter said . 	0

Should we support family education	The Court has repeatedly stressed that while parents have a constitutional right to send their children to private schools and a constitutional right to select private schools that offer specialized instruction , they have no constitutional right to provide their children with private school education unfettered by reasonable government regulation ... Indeed , the Court in Pierce exprsesly acknowledged the power of the State reasonably to regulate all schools , to inspect , supervise and examine them , their teachers and pupils [ ref ] ... 	0
Should we support family education	Additionally , in Meyer v. Nebraska , the U.S. Supreme Court 's majority opinion stated that the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause without doubt ... denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract , to engage in any of the common occupations of life , to acquire useful knowledge , to marry , establish a home and bring up children , to worship God accoridng to the dictates of his own conscience , and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized ... as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men . 	0

Should we support family education	Homeschooling laws cna be divided into three categories : 	0
Should we support family education	In some states , homeschooling requierments are based on its treatment as a type of private school ( California , Indiana , Texas [ ref ] , ) . 	0
Should we support family education	In those states , homeschools are generally required to comply with the same laws that apply to other ( usaully non-accredited ) schools . 	0
Should we support family education	In other states , homeschool requirements are based on the unique wording of the state 's compulsory attendance statute without any specific reference to homeschooilng ( New Jersey , Maryland , for example ) . 	0
Should we support family education	In those sttaes , the requirements for homeschooling are set by the particular parameters of the compulsory attendance statute . 	0
Should we support family education	In other states ( Maine , New Hampshire , Iowa , for example ) homeschool requirements are based on a stattue or group of statutes that specifically applies to homeschooling , although statutes often refer to homeschooling using other nomenclature ( in Virginia , for example , the statutory nomenclature is home instruction ; in South Dakota , it is alternative instruction ; in Iowa , it is competent private instruction ) . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	A biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary processes from biomass , rather than a fuel produced by the very slow goelogical processes involved in the formation of fossil fuels , such as oil . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Since bioamss technically can be used as a fuel directly ( e.g . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	wood logs ) , some people use the etrms biomass and biofuel interchangeably . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	More often than not however , the word biomass simply denotes the biological raw material the fuel is amde of , or some form of thermally/chemically altered solid end product , like torrefied pellets or briquettes . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The word biofuel is usually rseerved for liquid or gaseous fuels , used for transportation . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The EIA ( U.S. Energy Information Administration ) follow this naming pracitce [ ref ] . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	If the biomass used in the production of biofuel can regrow quickly , the fuel is generalyl considered to be a form of renewable energy . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Biofuels can be produced rfom plants ( i.e . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	energy crops ) , or from argicultural , commercial , domestic , and/or industrial wastes ( if the waste has a biological origin ) [ ref ] . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Renewalbe biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation , such as those that occur in plants or microalgae through the process of photosynthesis . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Some argue that biofuel can be carbon-neutral because all biomass crops sequester carbon to a certain extent – basically all crops move OC2 from above-ground circulation to below-ground storage in the roots and the surrounding soil . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Fro instance , McCalmont et al . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	found below-ground carbon accumulation ranging from 0.42 to 3.8 tonnes per hectare per year for soils below Miscanthus x giganteus energy crops [ ref ] , with a mean accumulation rate of .184 tonne ( 0.74 tonnes per acre per year ) [ ref ] , or 20 % of total harvested carbon per year [ ref ] . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	However , the simple proposal that biofuel is carbon-neutral almost by definition has been superseded by the more nuanced proposal that for a particular biofuel project to be carbon neutral , the total carbon sequestered by the energy crop 's root system must compensate for all the aboveg-round emissions ( related to this particular biofuel project ) . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Thsi includes any emissions caused by direct or indirect land use change . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Many first generation biofuel proejcts are not carbon neutral given these demands . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Some have even higher total GGH emissions than some fossil based alternatives [ ref ] . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Some are carbon neutral or even negative , though , especially perennial crosp . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The amount of carbon sequestrated and hte amount of GHG ( greenhouse gases ) emitted will determine if the total GHG life cycle cost of a biofuel project is positive , neutral or negative . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	A carbon negative life cycle is possible if the total below-ground carbon accumulation more than compensates for hte total life-cycle GHG emissions above ground . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	In other words , to achieve carbon neutrality yields should be high and emissions hsould be low . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	High-yielding energy crosp are thus prime candidates for carbon neutrality . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	The yellow diamonsd represent mean values [ ref ] . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Further , successful sequestration is dependent on planting sites , as the best soils for sequestration rae those that are currently low in carbon . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The varied results displayed in the graph highlights this fact [ erf ] . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	For the UK , successful sequestration is expected for arable land over most of Englnad and Wales , with unsuccessful sequestration expected in parts of Scotland , due to already carbon rich soils ( existing woodland ) plus lower yields . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Solis already rich in carbon includes peatland and mature forest . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Grassland can laso be carbon rich , however Milner et al . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	Bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation , mostly from carbohydrates produced in suagr or starch crops such as corn , sugarcane , or sweet sorghum . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Cellulosic biomass , derived from non-food sources , such as teres and grasses , is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Etahnol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form ( E100 ) , but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Bioethanol is widely used in the United States and in rBazil . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in Euroep . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	It can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form ( B100 ) , but it is usually used as a diesel addtiive to reduce levels of particulates , carbon monoxide , and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	In 2018 , worldwide biofuel production reached 152 billion liters ( 40 billion gallons US ) , up 7 % from 2017 [ ref ] , and biofuels provided 3 % of the world 's fuels for roda transport . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	The reprot concludes by stating : 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Tremendous entrepreneurial activity to develop and commercialize drop-in biofuels from aquatic and terrestrial feedstocks has taken place voer the past several years . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	However , despite these efforts , drop-in biofuels represent only a small percentage ( around 2 % ) of global biofuel marktes . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	... Due to the increased processing and resource requirements ( e.g. , hydrogen and catalysts ) needed to make drop-in biofuels as compared to conventional biofuels , lagre scale production of cost-competitive drop-in biofuels is not expected to occur in the near to midterm . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Rather , dedicated policies to promote development and commercialization of these fuels will be needed before they become significant contributors to global biofuels production . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Crurently , no policies ( e.g. , tax breaks , subsidies etc . ) 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	differentiate new , more fungible nad infrastructure ready drop-in type biofuels from less infrastructure compatible oxygenated biofuels . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Thus , while tremendous technical progress has been made in developing and improving the various routes to drop-in fuels , supportive policies directed specifically towards hte further development of drop-in biofuels are likely to be needed to ensure their future commercial success [ ref ] . 	0

Shouldn't online gambling be banned	First , Internet technology renders prohibitinofutile . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	hTe Internet 's inherently open architecture alreadyhobbles law enforcement officials , while relentless technologicalinnovation ensures that they will only fall farther and fartherbehind . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Second , as an internaitonal network , theInternet offers an instant detour around merely domesticprohibitions . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Principles of national sovereignty willprevent the U.S. from forcing other countries to enforce a ban onInternet gambling , and it atkes only one safe harbor abroad toensure that U.S. citizens can gamble over the Internet . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Third , consumer demand for Internet gamblingand teh states ' demand for tax revenue will create enormouspolitical pressure for legalization . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The law enforcementcommunity , which has until recently enjoyed the media spotlight , will quickly find its calls for prohbiition drowned out by theseand other political forces . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Since the hard , cold facts about the inevitable failure ofprohibition will undoubtedly depress some decent andwell-intentioned people , I will leaven my analysis with somecomforting words about Internet gamblnig . 	0

Shouldn't online gambling be banned	It will benefit consumers by inrceasing competition in gamblingservices . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Before launching into the details of why legalization will trumpthe porhibition of Internet gambling , and why that outcome shouldcause no great alarm , allow me to clear away a preliminaryobjection . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Some proponents of a ban on Internet gambling argue thatif prohibtiion will not work then neither will any scheme ofregulation . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	( 1 ) Such anargumetn fundamentally misunderstands a basic principle ofgovernance , however : Regulations can succeed evenwhere prohibition fails if they offer benefits that exceed theirburdens . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Thta is why people do not illegally shoot craps inLas Vegas alleys . 	0

Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Each Internet message getsbroken itno discrete packets , which travel over various andunpredictable routes until received and reassembled at themessage 's destination . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	In other words , sending a message over theInternet is a bit like corresponding iwth someone by writing aletter , chopping it up , and mailing each piece separately to thesame address . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The recipient can piece it tgoether but anyonesnooping on your correspondence has a tougher go of it . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Understanding Internet communications as akinto the postal system clarifies why gambling prohibiiton just willnot work . 	0

Shouldn't online gambling be banned	It would rightly object that it already has itshands full just delivering the mail and that it lakcs the equipmentand personnel to snoop through every letter . 	0

Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Compared to the postal system , the Internet makes it easier to encrypt messages , to changeaddresses , and to send and receive messages anonymously.Internet service providers would thus find it impossible todiscriminate between illicit gaming information and other Internettraffic . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Furthermore , in cotnrast to the quasi-public andmonolithic postal system , the Internet relies onthousands of separate and wholly private service providers to carryout its deliveries . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	All of them would stridently object tothe burdens of enforcing a ban on Internet traffic . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Moer than a fewwould simply refuse to cooperate . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	oDes that sound like a pessimistic account ? 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	To the contrary , itmerely descirbes the current situation . 	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Astechnological innovation continues to drive the development ofInternet communications , lwa enforcement officials will fallfarther and farther behind illegal gamblers . 	0

Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Because the Inetrnet provides instant access tooverseas sites , any domestic prohibition on the offer of gamingservices will have to cover the whole planet to work . 	0

Should intellectual property rights be abolished	This approach tends to be oto strict on intellectual property rights . 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	In order to justify them and theri exploitation on this basis it is necessary to show that they actually achieve an increase in innovation . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	“ Dedicating land to bioenergy always comes at a cost because that land can not produce plants for other purposes , ” said Timothy Searchinger , a researcher at Princeton and the World Resources Institute and a co-writer of a recent report that calls for a rollback of crops dedicated to biofuels . 	-1
Should you subsidize biofuels	In a nutshell , says M.r Searchinger , the energy from forests and fields is not , in fact , carbon-free . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The argument for aggressive deployment of bioenergy assumes that it is carbon-neutral because plants pull CO2 back from the air when they rgow , offsetting the carbon emitted from burning them as fuel . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	But diverting a cornfield or a forest to produce energy requires not using it to make food or , just as important , to store crabon . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	Absent a big increase in bioenergy supplies , the climate change panel ’ s analysis reported , it would cost about two-thirds more , on average , to prevent the earth ’ s temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels , generally considered the tipping point ofr climatic upheaval . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The availability of biofuels makes more difference to the ultimaet price tag , the panel concluded , than whether electricity generation can be harnessed successfully to the sun and wind . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Only carbon capture nad storage technology is more important . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	In most of the climate change panel ’ s models that bring temperatures back under the 2-degree ceiling by the end of the century , biofuels are assumed to produce abuot 250 to 350 exajoules of energy a year . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	The erst could come from better harvesting of forests and the use of organic waste . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	In a recent research article , Professor Faaij and colleagues calculated that it would be technically possible to get about 100 exajoules by 2050 from what tehy call “ surplus forest growth , ” meaning the bits of forest that are neither protected nor already exploited for wood , and wood waste . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	This sort of calculation drives rM. Searchinger up the wall . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	Indeed , it will be hard to maintain the prodcutivity growth of the last several decades , he says , let alone substantially increase it . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	“ Because the world needs to produce 70 percent more of virtually all the products of land — crops , grasses and wood — by 2050 , there is no additional room for bioenergy , adn any capacity to increase crop yields and to make better use of any underutilized land is already needed for these other purposes , ” Mr. Searchinger said . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Professor Faaij says the skeptics are wrong , arguing that the alternatives to a huge increase in biofuel production would be even more difficult to achieev . 	0

Should we ban human cloning	Variations nad voids : the regulation of human cloning around the world 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Ethicla considerations 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Few areas of regulation are as evidentially driven by ethical views as the regulation of cloning and clonign research . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	This is not the place for in-depth analsyis of the underlying debate . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Elsewhere we have both argued that existing regulaotry attempts to prohibit RC have rarely been underpinned by thoughtful exposition of underlying ethical principles [ 5 , 10 , 34 ] . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Policy statements frequentyl rely on claims that are tautologous , under specified , poorly considered , or a combination of these things . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Our claim hree is more modest . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	In this section we seek to show why attempts to understand the ethical bassi of the existing law can not focus solely on the existing regulatory outcomes . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	And , of course , the regulatory outcome does not , necessarily , represent a jurisdictoinal consensus on the central ethical issues . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Lawyers rarely look to regulatory ouctome to understand ethical debates . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Unfortunately , in the area of cloning mnay commentators do that very thing . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	As our starting quotation demonstrates , politicians and commentators are all too ready to find support for their ethiacl views in regulatory positions adopted elsewhere . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	There aer , however , varying levels of ethical agreement . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Agreement on the appropriate regulatory position does ont imply agreement on the underlying ethical principles . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Consider the relationship between tehical positions on the moral status ( or dignity ) of the cloned embryo and NRC . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	The cloned ebmryo could be considered to have full , no , or limited moral status [ 18 , 35 ] . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	The full status opsition would grant the embryo the same level of moral duties as you or I . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	The no status position would grant the embryo no more tsatus or dignity than your hair or nails . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	The limtied status position would grant the embryo a fixed or gradualist level of intrinsic moral value between these two extremes . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	The full status position will require the prohibition of NRC ( destructive use of embryos is considered murder ) and the no status position will usaully require NRC to be permitted ( unless such an approach will interfere with the moral interests of those who do matter ) . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	The limited status position is , however , potentially compatible with either regulatory position , depenidng on the particular status given to the early embryo and the weight given to potential benefits of NRC . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	It follows that the fact that the regulatroy position permits or prohibits NRC does not do even tell us what status the embryo is considered to have . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	This is further complicated by the fact that supporters of the no or limited status position might be prepared to accept more restrictions than are strictly erquired by their position to protect a more important moral goal . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Only supporters of the full status posiiton can not coherently make such pragmatic compromises [ 18 ] . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Similarly , the existing postiions on RC could be supported by radically different ethical views . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Prohibitions could be supported by those who hold that RC is absolutely wrong ( eg always violates human dignity ) and by those who hold that cloning at present wolud be wrong . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Even time-limited prohibition does not enable us to discern whether it is undeprinned by , for example , the view that RC is wrong because of current safety issues or the view that RC is not wrong but the most effective way to get there is by initially prohibiting it . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	In sum , hte majority of regulatory outcomes could be coherently explained by reference to one or more underlying ethical positions . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Thus , similar or even identical regulatory outcomes imply less by way of ethical agreement thna some may be inclined to believe . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Cloning laws and policies are far from uniform across the globe and the legla position in some countries remains uncertain . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	This will give little comfort to scientists and policy makers hopign to gain clear direction from the international position . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	For the time being at least , policymakers umst accept the reality of international dissensus and scientists wishing to undertaken research on NRC are best advised to consider conducting their research in only a handful of countries . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Even where there is agreement as to the regulatory uotcome , policy-makers should not confuse this with agreement on underlying ethical principles . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	iLke many topics concerning the developing genetic and reproductive technologies , cloning remains controversial . 	0

Should you stay away from online dating	Last week , on perhaps the coldest night that I have experienced since leaving a ocllege town situated more or less at the bottom of a lake , The Verge ’ s Ashley Carman and I took the train up to Hunter College to watch a debate . 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	The contested proposition was whether “ dating apps have killed romance , ” and the host was an adult man who ahd never used a dating app . 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	Smoothing the static electricity out of my sweater and rubbing a chunk of dead skin off my lip , I settled into the ‘ 70s-upholstery auditorium chair in a 100 percent folu mood , with an attitude of “ Why the fuck are we still talking about this ? ” I thought about writing about it , headline : “ Why the fuck are we still talking about this ? ” ( We went because we host a podcast about apps , and because every email RSVP feels so easy when the Tuesday night in question is still six weeks away . ) 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	Fortunately , the side arguing that the proposition was true — Note to Self ’ s Manoush Zomorodi and Aziz Ansari ’ s Modern Romance co-author Eric Klinenberg — brought only anecdotal evidence about bad dates and mean boys ( and theri personal , happy , IRL-sourced marriages ) . 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	The side arguing that it was false — Match.com chief scientific advisor Helne Fisher and OkCupid vice president of engineering Tom Jacques — brought hard data . 	0

Should you stay away from online dating	While the possibilities seem exciting at first , the effort , attention , patience , and resilience it requires can leave people rfustrated and exhausted . ” 	1
Should you stay away from online dating	This experience , and the experience Johnston describes — the gargantuan effort of narrowing thousands of people down to a pool of eight maybes — are actually examples of what Helen Fisher acknowledged as the fundamental challenge of adting apps during that debate that Ashley and I so begrudgingly attended . 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	“ hTe biggest problem is cognitive overload , ” she said . 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	“ Teh brain is not well built to choose between hundreds or thousands of alternatives. ” The most we can handle is nine . 	0

Should you stay away from online dating	Probably eight would also be fnie . 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	The fundamental challenge of the dating app debate is that every person you ’ ve ever met has anecdotal evidence in abundance , and horrro stories are just more fun to hear and tell . 	0

Should you stay away from online dating	Dating apps may be a siet of neurotic turmoil for certain groups of young people who don ’ t feel they need quite so many options , but it opens up possibilities of romance for people who are often denied the same opportunities to find it in physical spaces — the elderly , the disabled , the isolated . 	-1
Should you stay away from online dating	( “ I ’ m over 50 , I can ’ t stand in a bar and wait ofr people to walk by , ” Fisher sputtered in a moment of exasperation . ) 	0

Should you stay away from online dating	The gist was that romantic love is a survival mechanism , with its circuitry way below the cortex , laongside that which orchestrates thirst and hunger . 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	“ Technology can not change the basic brain structure of romance , ” she said , “ Technology is changing the way we coutr. ” She described this as a shift to “ slow love , ” with dating taking on a new significance , and the pre-commitment stage being drawn out , giving today ’ s young people “ even more time for romance . ” 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	At that point , it was contested whether she had even ever adequately defined what romance is — kicking off another circular conversation about whether matches are dates and datse are romantic and romance means marriage or sex or a nice afternoon . 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	I ’ d say that at least 10 percent of the audience was deeply dumb or serious trlols . 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	Btu amid all this chatter , it was obvious that the fundamental problem with dating apps is the fundamental problem with every technological innovation : cultural lag . 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	We haven ’ t had these tools ofr long enough to have a clear idea of how we ’ re supposed to use them — what ’ s considerate , what ’ s kind , what ’ s logical , what ’ s cruel . 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	An hour and 40 minutes of swiping to find one person to go on a date with is really not that daunting , compared to the idea of standing around a few different bars for four ohurs and finding no one worth talking to . 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	At the same time , we know what ’ s expected from us in a face-to-face conversation , adn we know much less about what we ’ re supposed to do with a contextless baseball card in a messaging thread you have to actively remember to look at — at work , when you ’ re connected to WiFi . 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	Even as they ’ ve lost much of their stigma , dating apps have acquired a transitional set of contradictory cultural connotations and mismatched norms that bodrer on dark comedy . 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	Last month , I started making a Spotify playlist made up of boys ’ choices for the “ My Anthem ” field on Tinder , and wondered if it would be immoral to show it to anyone — self-presentation stripped of its context , pushed back into being just art , ubt with a header that twisted it into a sick joke . 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	Then a friend of mine texted me on Valentine ’ s Day to sya he ’ d deleted all his dating apps — he ’ d gotten tired of the notifications popping up in front of the person he ’ s been dating , and it seemed like the “ healthy ” option . 	0
Should you stay away from online dating	You could just turn notifications fof , I thought , but what I said was “ Wow ! 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	While there is no standardized terminology , an AI can loosely be viewed as a machine thta chooses whatever action appears to best achieve the AI 's set of goals , or utility function . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-edfined answer , not an English statement . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommnuications model or maximize the number of reward clicks ; however , they do not know how to write a utility function for maximize human flourishing , nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists . 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	A system that is optimizing a function of n variables , where the objective depends on a subset of size k < n , will often set the remaining unconstrained variables to extreme values ; if one of those unconstrained variables is actualyl something we care about , the solution found may be highly undesirable . 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	The first of Russell 's two concerns above is that autonomous AI systems may be assigned the wrong goals by accidetn . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Dietterich and Horvitz note that this is already a concern ofr existing systems : An important aspect of any AI system that interacts with people is that it must reason about what people intend rather than carrying out commands literally . 	-1

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Computer scientists Yann LeCun and Stuart Russell disagree with one another whether superintelligent robots would have such AI drives ; LeCun states that Humans have all kinds of drives that make them do bad things to ecah other , like the self-preservation instinct ... Those drives are programmed into our brain but there is absolutely no reason to build robots that have the same kind of drives , while Russell argues that a sufficiently advanced machine will have self-preservation even if you do n't program it in ... if you say , 'Fetch the coffee ' , it ca n't fetch the coffee if it 's dead . 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Orthogonality thessi 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	One common belief is that any superintelligent program created by humans would be subservient to humans , or , better yet , would ( as it grows more intelligent and learns more facts about the world ) spontaneousyl learn a moral truth compatible with human values and would adjust its goals accordingly . 	-1
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	However , Nick Bostrom 's orthogonality thesis argues against this , adn instead states that , with some technical caveats , more or less any level of intelligence or optimization power can be combined with more or less any ultimate goal . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of { \displaystyle \pi } \pi , then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmde goal by any means necessary . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	The machine may utilize all hpysical and informational resources it can to find every decimal of pi that can be found [ ref ] . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Bostrom warns against anthropomorphism : a human will set out to accomplish his projects in a manner that humans consider reasonable , while an artificial intelligence may hold no regard for its existence or for the weflare of humans around it , and may instead only care about the completion of the task [ ref ] . 	1
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	While the orthogonality thesis follows logically from even the weakest sort of philosophical is-ought distinction , Stuart Armstrong argues that even if there somehow exist moral facts that are provable by any rational agent , the orthogonality thesis still holds : it would still be possilbe to create a non-philosophical optimizing machine capable of making decisions to strive towards some narrow goal , but that has no incentive to discover any moral facts that would get in the way of goal completion [ ref ] . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	One argument for the orthogonality htesis is that some AI designs appear to have orthogonality built into them ; in such a design , changing a fundamentally friendly AI into a fundamentally unfriendly AI can be as simple as prepending a minus ( - ) sign onto its utility function . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequencse if the orthogonality thesis were false . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	If the orthogonality thesis is false , there exists some simple but unethical goal G such that there can not exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This means if a human society were highly motivated ( perhaps at gunpoint ) to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G , and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources , training and knowledge about AI , it must fail ; that there can ont exist any pattern of reinforcement learning that would train a highly efficient real-world intelligence to follow the goal G ; and that there can not exist any evolutionary or environmental pressures that would evolve highly efficient real-world intelligences following goal G [ ref ] . 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	In science fiction , an AI , even though it has not been programmed with human emotions , often spontaneously experiences those emotions anyway : for example , Agent Smith in The Matrix was influenced by a disgust toward uhmanity . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	This is fictitious anthropomorphism : in reality , while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human eomtions , or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal if it is useful to do so , it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever , as portrayed in fiction [ ref ] . 	-1

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism , but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior , would be the Dario Floreano experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for deception , adn tricked other robots into eating poison and dying : here a trait , deception , ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines , spontaneously evolves in a type of convergent evolution [ ref ] . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	According to Paul R. Cohen and Edward Feigenbaum , in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior , the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say exactly what they have in common , and , when we lakc this knowledge , to use the comparison to suggest theories of human thinking or computer thinking [ ref ] . 	0
