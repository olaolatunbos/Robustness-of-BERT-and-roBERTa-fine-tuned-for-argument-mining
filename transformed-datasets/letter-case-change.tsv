Should intellectual property rights be abolished	Should INTELLECTUAL property be abolished ? 	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	The Economist has recently popularised the notion that patents are bad FOR innovation . 	1

Should all museums be opened for free	For me , back in 2011 , the policy meant that WHILE on breaks from a double shift at a grim restaurant in Covent Garden , I could wander around , say , the National Gallery or National Portrait Gallery—places that feel worlds away from the realities outside—and feel just as entitled to their contents as anyone else . 	0

Should all museums be opened for free	The reasons are obvious : Like me , many urbanites like the idea that it ’ s not just the privileged that can afford museums , but the masses too—especially when THOSE institutions are funded in part by taxpayers . 	0
Should all museums be opened for free	The Met ’ s decision to scrap their pay-what-you-wish policy is limited to non-residents of New York state ( students from New Jersey and Connecticut will also be spared ) but the ID requirement could potentially exclude Some New Yorkers without proper documentation . 	0
Should all museums be opened for free	Beyond the specifics of enforcement , though , is the wider implication : It tells us that wide ACCESS to art is not only unsustainable , but that it ’ s not a civic priority , either . 	0
Should all museums be opened for free	While the piecemeal approach to arts funding in the US is a world away from the UK ’ s top-down approach , it is true that there ARE plenty of museums and institutions in New York City which offer pay as you wish time windows ( some are sponsored by companies , such as Uniqlo ’ s partnership with MoMA ) , as well as museums that never charge . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	Does combating climate change require burning the world ’ s forests And crops for fuel ? 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	It certainly looks that way , judging from the aggressive mandates governments around the globe have set to incorporate bioenergy into their TRANSPORTATION fuels in the hope of limiting the world ’ s overwhelming dependence on gasoline and diesel to move people and goods . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	While biofuels account for only about 2.5 percent today , the European Union expects renewable Energy — mostly biofuels — to account for 10 percent of its transportation fuel by 2020 . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	“ Dedicating land to bioenergy always comes at a cost because that land can not produce plants for other purposes , ” said Timothy Searchinger , a researcher at Princeton and the World Resources iNSTITUTE and a co-writer of a recent report that calls for a rollback of crops dedicated to biofuels . 	-1
Should you subsidize biofuels	In a nutshell , says Mr. Searchinger , the energy from Forests and fields is not , in fact , carbon-free . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The argument for aggressive deployment of bioenergy assumes that it is carbon-neutral because Plants pull CO2 back from the air when they grow , offsetting the carbon emitted from burning them as fuel . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	But diverting a cornfield or a forest to produce energy requires not using it to make food or , JUST as important , to store carbon . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	“ Burning biomass instead of fossil fuels does not reduce the carbon emitted by power plants , ” a group of 78 scientists wrote on Monday to gina McCarthy , the E.P.A. ’ s director , warning against the new power plant policy . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	“ Burning biomass , such as trees , that would otherwise continue to absorb and store CARBON comes at the expense of reduced carbon storage . ” 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	If the critics are right , the Hunt for biomass on a large scale could vastly change the world ’ s land use , food supply and ecosystems while helping little to prevent climate change . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The argument For caution has so far mostly fallen on deaf ears . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The reason is that policy makers SEE little choice . 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	Riddled with the usual uncertainties of science , it seemed pretty certain of one thing : Doing it Without biofuels would be much harder . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Absent a big increase in bioenergy supplies , the climate change panel ’ s analysis reported , it would cost about Two-thirds more , on average , to prevent the earth ’ s temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels , generally considered the tipping point for climatic upheaval . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The availability of biofuels makes more difference to the ultimate price tag , the panel concluded , than Whether electricity generation can be harnessed successfully to the sun and wind . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Only carbon capture and storage technology is more Important . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	To put that in context , 300 exajoules is over half the world ’ s Current energy consumption . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Today , the energy content of all the biomass HARVESTED for food , fodder and everything else amounts to about 220 exajoules . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The question is , Where will THE land to produce all this additional vegetation come from ? 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	As a committee of the European Environmental Agency Noted , to reduce the amount of CO2 in the air , bioenergy production “ must increase the total amount of plant growth , making more plants available for energy use while preserving other benefits . ” 	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	Deploying just 10 percent of the world ’ s FIVE billion hectares currently used for crops and pastures to grow biofuels could generate 100 to 150 exajoules by the end of the century . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	An additional 60 to 70 could be had from planting biofuels on currently degraded LAND . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The rest could come from better harvesting of forests and THE use of organic waste . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	In a recent research article , Professor Faaij and colleagues calculated that it would be technically possible to get about 100 exajoules by 2050 from what they call “ surplus forest growth , ” MEANING the bits of forest that are neither protected nor already exploited for wood , and wood waste . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	This sort of calculation Drives Mr. Searchinger up the wall . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	“ Surplus forest growth ” he said , is already pulling CO2 from the AIR . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Harvesting it for energy will provide no further BENEFIT for climate change . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The same could be said of idled agricultural land , where forest usually starts regrowing soon , capturing carbon FROM the air . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	“ In many contexts , allowing a forest to grow will do more to reduce carbon DIOXIDE in the atmosphere for decades than producing bioenergy , ” he told me . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	And he finds the estimates of future agricultural productivity unbelievable when applied to Any reasonable understanding of the real world . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Indeed , it will be hard to maintain the PRODUCTIVITY growth of the last several decades , he says , let alone substantially increase it . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	“ Because the world needs to produce 70 percent more of virtually all the products of land — crops , grasses and wood — by 2050 , there is no additional room for bioenergy , and any capacity to increase crop yields and to make better use of any underutilized land is already needed for these other Purposes , ” Mr. Searchinger said . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Professor Faaij says the Skeptics are wrong , arguing that the alternatives to a huge increase in biofuel production would be even more difficult to achieve . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	But it could be POSSIBLE to produce the zero-carbon energy the world will need without incurring such steep opportunity costs . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Much of the transport fleet could be electrified , reducing Demand for liquid fuels . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Solar power could be used to Produce hydrogen to burn in fuel cells . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	There is probably a Limited role for biofuels from waste products . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	But the biofuels juggernaut — Which has helped garner the support of agribusiness in the battle against climate change — could end up doing more harm than good . 	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The United States used to rely heavily on bioenergy for transport : 100 years ago , tens of millions of acres were devoted to growing feed for pack ANIMALS . 	0

Should we ban human cloning	Variations and voids : the regulation of human CLONING around the world 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Ethical Considerations 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Few areas of regulation are as evidentially driven by ethical views as the regulation of cloning and cloning Research . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	This is not the place for in-depth analysis of the UNDERLYING debate . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Elsewhere we have both argued That existing regulatory attempts to prohibit RC have rarely been underpinned by thoughtful exposition of underlying ethical principles [ 5 , 10 , 34 ] . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Policy statements frequently rely on claims that are tautologous , under specified , poorly considered , or a combination of these THINGS . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Our claim here is MORE modest . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	In this section we seek to SHOW why attempts to understand the ethical basis of the existing law can not focus solely on the existing regulatory outcomes . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	And , of course , the regulatory outcome does not , necessarily , represent a jurisdictional consensus on THE central ethical issues . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Lawyers rarely look to REGULATORY outcome to understand ethical debates . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Unfortunately , in the area of cloning Many commentators do that very thing . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	As our starting quotation demonstrates , Politicians and commentators are all too ready to find support for their ethical views in regulatory positions adopted elsewhere . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	There are , However , varying levels of ethical agreement . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Agreement on the appropriate REGULATORY position does not imply agreement on the underlying ethical principles . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Consider the RELATIONSHIP between ethical positions on the moral status ( or dignity ) of the cloned embryo and NRC . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	The Cloned embryo could be considered to have full , no , or limited moral status [ 18 , 35 ] . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	The full status POSITION would grant the embryo the same level of moral duties as you or I . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	The no status position would grant the embryo no more status or dignity THAN your hair or nails . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	The Limited status position would grant the embryo a fixed or gradualist level of intrinsic moral value between these two extremes . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	The full status position will require the prohibition of NRC ( destructive use of embryos is considered murder ) and the no status position will usually require NRC to be permitted ( unless such an approach will interfere with the moral interests of those who do Matter ) . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	The limited status position is , however , potentially compatible with either regulatory position , depending on the particular status given to the Early embryo and the weight given to potential benefits of NRC . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	It follows that the fact that the regulatory position permits or prohibits NRC does not do even tell us what status the embryo is CONSIDERED to have . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	This is further complicated by the fact that supporters of the no or limited status position Might be prepared to accept more restrictions than are strictly required by their position to protect a more important moral goal . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Only supporters of the full status position can not coherently make Such pragmatic compromises [ 18 ] . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Similarly , the existing positions on RC could be supported by radically Different ethical views . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Prohibitions could be supported by those Who hold that RC is absolutely wrong ( eg always violates human dignity ) and by those who hold that cloning at present would be wrong . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Even time-limited prohibition does not enable us to discern whether it is underpinned by , for example , the view that RC is wrong because of current safety issues or the view that RC is not wrong but the most EFFECTIVE way to get there is by initially prohibiting it . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	In sum , the Majority of regulatory outcomes could be coherently explained by reference to one or more underlying ethical positions . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Thus , similar or even identical regulatory outcomes imply less by way of ethical agreement Than some may be inclined to believe . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Cloning LAWS and policies are far from uniform across the globe and the legal position in some countries remains uncertain . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	This will give little comfort to scientists and policy makers hoping to gain clear direction from The international position . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	For the time being at least , policymakers must accept the reality of international dissensus AND scientists wishing to undertaken research on NRC are best advised to consider conducting their research in only a handful of countries . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Even where there is agreement as to the regulatory outcome , policy-makers should Not confuse this with agreement on underlying ethical principles . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	lIKE many topics concerning the developing genetic and reproductive technologies , cloning remains controversial . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Cloning humans often creates a “ Sixth dAY ” debate about ethics . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Many of our creation stories suggest that a deity produced two humans to Begin populating our planet . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	This scientific process would change that process so that Natural reproduction wouldn ’ t be the only way to have children . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Anyone could potentially copy themselves with some cell collection and a laboratory Setting that can grow a fetus . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	When we examine the advantages and Disadvantages of cloning humans , we ’ re asking ourselves the deeper theological questions that may not have answers . 	0
Should we ban human cloning	would each copy have a soul ? 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Does consciousness transfer into THE new body ? 	0
Should we ban human cloning	Does a human clone age FASTER than offspring that are produced from more natural methods ? 	0
Should we ban human cloning	These are questions we might not need to answer just yet , but The science of cloning is advancing . 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	While there is no standardized terminology , an AI can loosely be viewed as a machine that chooses whatever action appears to best achieve the AI 's set of goals , or utility FUNCTION . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined ANSWER , not an English statement . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model or maximize the number of reward clicks ; however , they do not know how to write a utility function for maximize human flourishing , nor is it CURRENTLY clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists . 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Computer scientists Yann LeCun and Stuart Russell disagree with one another whether superintelligent robots would have such AI drives ; LeCun states that Humans have all KINDS of drives that make them do bad things to each other , like the self-preservation instinct ... Those drives are programmed into our brain but there is absolutely no reason to build robots that have the same kind of drives , while Russell argues that a sufficiently advanced machine will have self-preservation even if you do n't program it in ... if you say , 'Fetch the coffee ' , it ca n't fetch the coffee if it 's dead . 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Orthogonality THESIS 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	One common belief is THAT any superintelligent program created by humans would be subservient to humans , or , better yet , would ( as it grows more intelligent and learns more facts about the world ) spontaneously learn a moral truth compatible with human values and would adjust its goals accordingly . 	-1
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	However , Nick Bostrom 's orthogonality thesis argues against this , and instead states that , with some technical caveats , more or less any level of intelligence or optimization power can be combined with more or less any ultimate GOAL . 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Bostrom warns against anthropomorphism : a human WILL set out to accomplish his projects in a manner that humans consider reasonable , while an artificial intelligence may hold no regard for its existence or for the welfare of humans around it , and may instead only care about the completion of the task [ ref ] . 	1
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	While the orthogonality thesis follows logically from even the weakest sort of philosophical is-ought distinction , Stuart Armstrong argues that even if there somehow EXIST moral facts that are provable by any rational agent , the orthogonality thesis still holds : it would still be possible to create a non-philosophical optimizing machine capable of making decisions to strive towards some narrow goal , but that has no incentive to discover any moral facts that would get in the way of goal completion [ ref ] . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	One argument for the orthogonality thesis is that some AI designs appear to have orthogonality built into them ; in such a design , changing a fundamentally friendly AI into a fundamentally unfriendly AI can be as simple as prepending a MINUS ( - ) sign onto its utility function . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences if the orthogonality thesis were False . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	If the orthogonality thesis is false , there exists some simple but unethical goal G such that there can not exist any efficient real-world Algorithm with goal G. This means if a human society were highly motivated ( perhaps at gunpoint ) to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G , and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources , training and knowledge about AI , it must fail ; that there can not exist any pattern of reinforcement learning that would train a highly efficient real-world intelligence to follow the goal G ; and that there can not exist any evolutionary or environmental pressures that would evolve highly efficient real-world intelligences following goal G [ ref ] . 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	This is fictitious anthropomorphism : in reality , while an Artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions , or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal if it is useful to do so , it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever , as portrayed in fiction [ ref ] . 	-1

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	According to Paul R. Cohen and Edward Feigenbaum , in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior , the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say exactly what they have in common , and , when we lack this knowledge , to use THE comparison to suggest theories of human thinking or computer thinking [ ref ] . 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Possibility of unfriendly AI preceding FRIENDLY AI 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Is strong AI inherently Dangerous ? 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	A significant problem is that Unfriendly artificial intelligence is likely to be much easier to create than friendly AI . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	While both require large advances in recursive optimisation process design , friendly AI also requires the ability to Make goal structures invariant under self-improvement ( or the AI could transform itself into something unfriendly ) and a goal structure that aligns with human values and does not automatically destroy the entire human race . 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	While an AI takeover is thus a possible result of THE invention of artificial intelligence , a peaceful outcome is not necessarily impossible [ according to whom ? 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	tHE fear of cybernetic revolt is often based on interpretations of humanity 's history , which is rife with incidents of enslavement and genocide . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Such fears stem from a BELIEF that competitiveness and aggression are necessary in any intelligent being 's goal system . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	However , such human competitiveness stems from the EVOLUTIONARY background to our intelligence , where the survival and reproduction of genes in the face of human and non-human competitors was the central goal [ ref ] . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	In fact , an arbitrary intelligence could have arbitrary goals : there is no particular reason that an artificially intelligent machine ( not sharing humanity 's evolutionary context ) would be hostile—or friendly—unless its creator programs it to be such and it is not inclined or capable of Modifying its programming . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	But the question remains : WHAT would happen if AI systems could interact and evolve ( evolution in this context means self-modification or selection and reproduction ) and need to compete over resources , would that create goals of self-preservation ? 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	AI 's goal of self-preservation could be in CONFLICT with some goals of humans . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Some scientists dispute the likelihood of cybernetic revolts as depicted in science fiction such as The Matrix , claiming that it is more likely that any Artificial intelligence powerful enough to threaten humanity would probably be programmed not to attack it [ citation needed ] . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	This would not , however , protect against The possibility of a revolt initiated by terrorists , or by accident . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Artificial General Intelligence researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky has stated on this note That , probabilistically , humanity is less likely to be threatened by deliberately aggressive AIs than by AIs which were programmed such that their goals are unintentionally incompatible with human survival or well-being ( as in the film I , Robot and in the short story The Evitable Conflict ) . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Steve Omohundro suggests that present-day automation systems are not designed for safety and that AIs may blindly optimize Narrow utility functions ( say , playing chess at all costs ) , leading them to seek self-preservation and elimination of obstacles , including humans who might turn them off [ ref ] . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Another factor which may negate the likelihood of an AI takeover is the vast difference between humans and AIs in terms of the resources necessary for SURVIVAL . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Humans require a wet , ORGANIC , temperate , oxygen-laden environment while an AI might thrive essentially anywhere because their construction and energy needs would most likely be largely non-organic [ dubious – discuss ] . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	With little or no competition for resources , conflict would perhaps be less likely no matter what sort of motivational architecture an artificial Intelligence was given , especially provided with the superabundance of non-organic material resources in , for instance , the asteroid belt . 	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	An AGI 's creators would HAVE an important advantage in preventing a hostile AI takeover : they could choose to attempt to keep the AI in a box , and deliberately limit its abilities [ citation needed ] . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	The tradeoff in boxing is that the creators presumably built the AGI for some concrete purpose ; the more restrictions they place on the AGI , the less useful the AGI Will be to its creators . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	( At an extreme , pulling The plug on the AGI makes it useless , and is therefore not a viable long-term solution . 	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	) [ citation needed ] A sufficiently strong superintelligence might find unexpected ways to escape the box , for example by social manipulation , or by providing the schematic for a Device that ostensibly aids its creators but in reality brings about the AGI 's freedom , once built [ citation needed ] . 	0
