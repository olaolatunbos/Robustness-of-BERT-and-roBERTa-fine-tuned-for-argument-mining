Should you restrict reality TV	"It creates extremely attractive content, sometimes even addictive."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"This would be good if their audience consisted entirely of adults: adults usually have established patterns of behavior, molded perspectives, and tend to view the TV content of reality as mere entertainment."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"At the same time, a large percentage of viewers are teenagers or even children – and in this case, the global popularity of reality shows may not be as harmless after all."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"Although its appearance and development is often associated in the late 1990s and with youth-oriented channels such as MTV, the history of reality television goes a little further in time."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	It all began in the 1970s with the program entitled “An American Family” released into the air (ANVC).	0

Should you restrict reality TV	"The idea of a reality show is a voyeur: a group of “real people” allows cameramen, directors and other television staff to enter their homes or other everyday environments, and allows them to broadcast their lives on television."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"To make these programmes more interactive, producers often start all kinds of voting, for example, when the audience decides the fate of programme participants through online surveys or phone calls."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"Rather often, even adult viewers rarely contemplate the possibility that the people they see are actors, that they follow a script, and that the plot and dynamics of the show often reflect the demands and expectations of the target audience (Screenrant)."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"In the case of teenagers, they tend to see behavior patterns and relationship models represented in their favorite programs as copies, especially if there are celebrities involved – and this is just one of the many problems."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"In particular, reality television often shows excessive amounts of aggression; this is mainly needed to keep the audience “at their feet,” which makes them guess the results of numerous encouraged interpersonal conflicts."	1
Should you restrict reality TV	"For example, programmes targeting women may promote gossip, condescension and harassment as part of women’s “normal” behaviour (The MGH Clay Center for Young Healthy Minds)."	0
Should you restrict reality TV	"Shows aimed at men can do the same, encouraging the use of aggression or even violence as a means of resolving interpersonal conflicts and/or relationship problems."	0

Should you restrict reality TV	"Therefore, it is advisable for teens to watch reality shows under the control of their parents, or not to see them at all."	0
Should we support animal rights	Movement for animal rights	0
Should we support animal rights	"The movement for animal rights, sometimes called the movement of animal liberation, animal person, or animal defense movement, is a social movement that seeks to put an end to the rigid moral and legal distinction that is established between human and non-human animals, to end the status of animals as property, and to end their use in the research, food, clothing and entertainment industries."	0
Should we support animal rights	Terms and factions	0
Should we support animal rights	"All animal liberationists believe that the individual interests of non-human animals deserve recognition and protection, but the movement can be divided into two broad fields."	1
Should we support animal rights	"Animal rights advocates, or liberationists of rights, believe that these basic interests confer moral rights of some kind on animals, and/or should confer legal rights on them;[1] see, for example, Tom Regan's work."	0
Should we support animal rights	"The utilitarian liberationists, on the other hand, do not believe that animals possess moral rights, but argue, for utilitarian reasons — utilitarianism in its simplest form advocating that we base moral decisions on the greatest happiness of number — that, because animals have the ability to suffer, their suffering must be taken into account in any moral philosophy."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Excluding animals from that consideration, they argue, is a form of discrimination they call speciesism; see, for example, Peter Singer's work [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Despite these differences, the terms animal release and animal rights are generally used interchangeably."	0

Should we support animal rights	"Actors of the reformist movement diagnose the problem as a problem of non-human animal abuse, offer a prognosis that includes welfare reform and employ frameworks of action that include moral shocks."	0
Should we support animal rights	It has been observed that the power of the animal rights movement in the United States is centralized in professionalized non-profit organizations that prefer moderate welfare reform objectives and tend to be isomorphic [ref].	0
Should we support animal rights	"The abolitionist faction diagnoses the problem as one of non-human animal use, offers a prognosis that includes vegan extension, and employs frameworks of action including a rational and theoretical approach."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Gary Francione, a leader in abolitionism, formed his approach in response to the traditional movement's focus on policy reform."	0
Should we support animal rights	The members of the abolitionist faction consider policy reform counterproductive and depend on non-violent education and moral suasion in their repertoire of contests.	0
Should we support animal rights	They see the promotion of veganism as a low-cost means of opportunity to create an anti-species culture and pose an economic threat to the industrial complex of animal agriculture [ref].	0
Should we support animal rights	"Direct action or militant faction includes in its repertoire damage to the property of the contest, open releases, intimidation and direct violence."	0
Should we support animal rights	"With these, they offer a prognosis to the problem of animal use that focuses on changing society through force and fear."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Animal rights agents often reject this faction, pointing to violence as a counterproductive tactic that incites repression (e.g., the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act) and does not question existing systems economically or politically [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"The smaller factions include groups focused on the theory of animal rights based on faith and veganarchists, whose approach is characterized by a critique of capitalism on the basis that it has led to massive non-human, human and environmental exploitation [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Such fractionalization, the researchers have pointed out, is common to social movements and plays a role in sustaining their health [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	History	0
Should we support animal rights	"The Animal Rights Movement dates back to the animal protection movement in Victorian England, which was initiated by aristocratic moral crusaders in response to the ill-treatment of urban working horses and stray dogs."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Other early influences include: Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel, which drew attention to the dark operations of slaughterhouses; Henry Salt's treatises on the non-human rights of animals; which is based on human abolitionist arguments to recognize the personality of people considered to be property; and the Alcott House of New England, a community that serves as a stopover on the Underground Railroad and which requires its residents to eat a vegan diet [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"The contemporary movement is considered to have been founded in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s by a group of Oxford graduate philosophy college students, now known as Oxford Group [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"The group was led by Rosalind and Stanley Godlovitch, graduate philosophy students who had recently become vegetarians."	0
Should we support animal rights	"The Godlovitches met John Harris and David Wood, also graduates in philosophy, who were soon persuaded of arguments for animal rights and became vegetarians."	0
Should we support animal rights	"The group began to actively raise the issue with the pre-eminent moral philosophers of Oxford, including Professor Richard Hare, both personally and at lectures."	0
Should we support animal rights	"His approach was not based on sentimentalism (goodness to mute animals), but on the moral rights of animals."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Soon they developed (and borrowed) a range of powerful arguments in support of their views, so Oxford clinical psychologist Richard Ryder, who was soon to be part of the group, writes that there has rarely been such a rationally argued and intellectually well-armed cause [ref]."	0

Should we support animal rights	"We exploit them to serve our superstitions: while we used to sacrifice them to our gods and pluck out their bowels to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experience about their entanglement in hope—or in mere overchance—that so we could see a little more clearly in the present [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	“	0
Should we support animal rights	Philosophers found this article and were inspired by its vigorous non-sentimental polemic.	0
Should we support animal rights	"At about the same time, Ryder wrote three letters to the Daily Telegraph in response to Brophy's arguments [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Brophy read Ryder's letters and contacted the Godlovitches and John Harris, who had begun planning a book on the subject that was also partially inspired by Brophy's controversy."	0
Should we support animal rights	The philosophers had also gone to see Brophy about the possibility of a book of essays on the subject [ref].	0
Should we support animal rights	"Initially they thought that a book with contributions from Brophy, Ruth Harrison, Maureen Duffy and other well-known writers might be of interest to the editors, but after an initial proposal was rejected by the first editor to approach, Giles Gordon of Victor Gollancz suggested that the work would be more viable if it included his own writing."	0
Should we support animal rights	"This was the idea that became Animals, Men and Moral' (see below)."	0
Should we support animal rights	"In 1970, Ryder coined the phrase speciesism, using it first in a privately printed brochure to describe the allocation of value to the interests of beings on the basis of their belonging to a particular species [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Ryder later became a collaborator of Animals, Men and Morals: An Inquiry into the Mal Treatment of Non-humans (1972), edited by John Harris and the Godlovitches, a work that became highly influential [ref], as did the essay by Rosalind Godlovitch Animal and Morals, published the same year."	0
Should we support animal rights	"It was in a review of Animals, Men and Morals for the New York Review of Books that Australian philosopher Peter Singer first presented his basic arguments, based on utilitarianism and drawing an explicit comparison between women's liberation and animal liberation."	0
Should we support animal rights	"From the review came the Animal Liberation of Singer, published in 1975, now considered by many as the Bible of the movement."	0

Should we support animal rights	"Gender, class and other factors"	0
Should we support animal rights	Another factor fueling the movement for animal rights was the repulsion to televised sacrifices.	0
Should we support animal rights	"In the United States, the National Farmers' Organization carried out many public protest killings in the late 1960s and early 1970s."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Protesting low meat prices, farmers would kill their own animals in front of media representatives."	0
Should we support animal rights	The bodies were wasted and they didn't eat.	0
Should we support animal rights	"However, this effort was counterproductive because it enraged television audiences to see that animals were unnecessarily killed and wasted [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"The movement is predominantly made up of white women of the upper and middle class, due to their associations with the British Victorian animal protection movement and American movements of feminism and environmentalism [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"As such, the movement is widely associated in public spheres with women, femininity and effectiveness."	0
Should we support animal rights	The public perception of the movement is influenced by gender assessments; foreigners in the movement tend to see activists as irrational because of too emotional feelings.	0
Should we support animal rights	"Aware of this, activists have strategically incorporated men into positions of leadership and theoretical production, in order to legitimize the movement and counter popular beliefs over the primacy of emotion in the movement for animal rights."	0
Should we support animal rights	"This tactic is based on the popular perception of men as rational and not given to emotion, and follows a trend in the activism of the social movement that seeks to counter traditional associations with femininity and private spheres by emphasizing rationality, rights and justice [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	"In a case study, anti-hunting activism targets used class and gender markers to evaluate activists' claims."	0
Should we support animal rights	The irrational associations of the hunters with femininity and inexperienced in hunting and desert with white collar positions constituted the reasons for their dismissal of the activists' demands.	0
Should we support animal rights	"In contrast, hunters framed hunting in logical, scientific and altruistic terms, thus legitimizing hunting, called wildlife management, as a protective measure [ref]."	0
Should we support animal rights	It has been observed that the composition of the movement may discourage the mobilization of certain demographic groups.	0
Should we support animal rights	"An analysis of the contents of magazines from highly visible animal rights organizations (PeTA and VegNews) revealed that most prominent members were white, women and thin."	0
Should we support animal rights	"With this, and with the composition of the movement being mostly white, feminine and thin, it has been suggested that animal rights media represent an ideal activist type with such characteristics, and that this can mobilize thin white females while deterring others."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Racialized, sexualized, and size-focused campaign tactics can also serve to deter potential members from joining the movement."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Racialized tactics include the appropriation of African slavery and the language and images of the Holocaust, and have been considered insensitive and challenged by non-white communities."	0
Should we support animal rights	"In addition, the movement has maintained racist stereotypes about the predisposition of non-white individuals to animal cruelty; these stereotypes emerged in the United States and Britain after slavery, where non-whites were considered by law and society as a trend towards animal cruelty."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Sexualization of ideal women is used as a mobilization tactic, but it reduces support for ethically based campaigns and can be counterproductive, alienating women who do not have ideal body types."	0
Should we support animal rights	"Sizeism is used as a tactic to frame veganism as a healthy and positive lifestyle, aligned with a popular association of fat with moral failure."	0
Should we support animal rights	These tactics can contribute to gender inequality because the unrealistic and sexualized representations of women are linked to their social devaluation.	0
Should we support animal rights	"Their lack of diverse members can diminish the legitimacy and mobilization capacity of the movement, as members of marginalized groups are more likely to mobilize when they are represented in the movement."	0
Should we support animal rights	"An inclusive movement with strong group solidarity would reduce the opportunity costs associated with participation (e.g., social stigmatization, lack of alternatives, legal persecution) and thus serve to increase and maintain participation in the movement [ref]."	0

Does online shopping promote economic development	And that means that all these purchases are having a measurable impact on the local economy.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	Is that bad news impacting local businesses?	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	Reality is a little more complex.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	Online shopping can remove taxes from the local economy.	-1
Does online shopping promote economic development	Perhaps the biggest negative impact online sales have on the economy is that they reduce the amount of sales taxes that the state collects and other local taxes that cities and counties collect.	-1
Does online shopping promote economic development	Not all online retailers charge the appropriate sales tax or other local taxes for items customers buy in their online stores.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"As a result, residents of a state cannot pay sales taxes on online purchases they would have paid if they had made the same purchase at a brick and mortar store."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	This loss of income is measurable.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"In 2012, Indiana lost $195 million in tax revenue from sales to online purchases, according to the University of Tennessee."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	This number is almost certainly higher now that the popularity of online sales has skyrocketed.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"In an attempt to reduce these losses, Indiana passed a law in 2017, which came into effect in October 2018, requiring retailers who earn at least $100,000 in sales in Indiana or who serve at least 200 Indiana residents in a year to collect sales taxes on online purchases."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"However, this law does not affect smaller companies."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	It also does not apply to local taxes and therefore does not completely close the tax gap caused by online purchases.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	Online sales make it difficult for brick and mortar retailers to compete.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"Because many online retailers do not charge their customers sales tax, their purchases cost less."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"A 7 percent charge on a small purchase could be just a few cents or dollars, but the difference can add up to larger purchases."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"In addition, when customers are pinching pennies or doing a lot of shopping, such as during holidays, saving sales taxes can be important to them."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"As a result, brick and mortar stores that have to collect appropriate taxes sometimes have more difficulty competing with online retailers that do not add these taxes to the cost of their items."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"When customers choose to go online instead of going to a brick and mortar store to save money, they restrict the ability of the local company to grow."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	Online shopping takes money out of the local economy.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	The last negative impact online shopping has on the local economy is to get money out of that economy.	-1
Does online shopping promote economic development	"For example, if a customer buys a Christmas gift from Amazon instead of a local business, that money goes to the national retailer instead of the buyer community."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	This loss of income can restrict the local economy.	0

Does online shopping promote economic development	Less hire means less money flowing into the local economy.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	Less money flowing into the local economy means fewer jobs and less money available for residents to spend.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"They then spend less money locally, leading to a vicious circle that can keep communities from growing."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	Online shopping isn't all bad.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"As with any story, there are two sides."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"While online shopping can be removed from the local economy, it can also contribute to it in certain ways."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	The key is for local companies to enter the online market.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	The main disadvantages of online shopping seem to occur when consumers make such purchases to domestic companies rather than to local businesses.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"For example, a local business is likely to charge appropriate taxes for online purchases, and fall under Indiana law that requires certain businesses to charge sales taxes for online purchases."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"Similarly, when consumers shop online for local businesses, that money still goes to the local economy."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"Instead of losing money to non-local entities, the local economy still receives the money from these online purchases, as these purchases continue to be made from local businesses."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	The advantage of all this is that local companies must strive to create a vibrant online presence.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	Online shopping isn't going anywhere.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	Its convenience means that it is likely to continue to grow in popularity.	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"Instead of fighting this new reality, local companies can accept it."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	"Through digital marketing, they can build a website and advertising campaigns that put them in front of their target audiences."	0
Does online shopping promote economic development	It is not impossible to compete against large companies.	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	"At the national level, EU governments have in the past tried to promote production with general incentives and mandates to plant crops and build refineries and tax exemptions for those who sell biodiesel and those who produce electricity."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"These policies have led manufacturers to use the cheapest biofuels, rather than those that are best for the environment."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"Policies have also produced unintended consequences, such as the sale by farmers of food crops for use as biofuel, resulting in increases in food prices from pasta to beer."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"Last year, for example, the EU paid farmers a subsidy of EUR 45 per hectare, USD 26.71 per hectare, for any biofuel crop produced."	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	There is no incentive for them to switch to crops with better greenhouse gas profiles.	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"Last month, the Netherlands announced that it would no longer subsidize the import of palm oil - before its main source of green electricity - after researchers demonstrated that palm oil was grown on Asian plantations created from drained peatlands, with disastrous environmental consequences."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"To address these problems, Germany is planning to demand that a biofuel be certified as sustainable, based on its emission reductions and the way crops were grown, if the annual target of biofuels being 5.75 per cent of transport fuel is to be met."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"U.S. corn ethanol, for example, will have great difficulty meeting the new standard, because its CO2 reduction is only 10 to 20 percent of the regular gasoline level, said Jürgen Maier, director of the German Forum on Environment and Development, a non-governmental organization."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"Germany also plans to apply a sustainability standard for biofuels used to generate electricity: in the past, electricity companies using any type of biofuel received a higher rate than the market price."	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	"Under the new Swiss policy, which is scheduled for approval by the Federal Council at the end of this month, very few types of biofuels - such as residues such as maize stalks - will automatically benefit from financial incentives, such as tax relief."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"Food crops - sugar, beet, rapeseed and soya - will be classified into a second category, in which producers will have to demonstrate that their biofuel is beneficial to the environment, at many levels, throughout the life cycle of production."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"It will be difficult to make some Swiss crops that are now subsidized, such as rapeseed, meet the new standard."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"In addition, Swiss will apply an incremental tax reduction based on the economy of fuel production, regardless of where it has been produced."	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	"The emerging biofuel industries in many countries - even in the West - are reluctant to delay such payments, without which they fear they cannot be profitable."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"The strong tax reliefs for maize ethanol and subsidies for the construction of corn ethanol factories in the United States are more motivated by the desire to help farmers than by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, critics say."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Maize is a relatively inefficient crop for biofuel production as it requires intensive processing and in most cases only produces a lower emission benefit.	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"Three years ago, Quebec began building a subsidized corn ethanol plant, to advance towards the provincial target of providing 5% of its biofuels fuel by 2010."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"A few months ago, the Minister of Environment of the province announced that he would not build any more."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"We had to think about the environmental impacts of corn-based ethanol, the availability of raw material and also greenhouse gas emissions, said Daniel Bienvenue, deputy minister of Energy Strategy of the province."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"The existing maize ethanol plant will provide about one third of the provincial share of biofuels, and the rest will be generated by other second-generation biofuels."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"The Quebec government, like many others, is supporting research to make biofuel from waste products such as corn stalks and forest waste."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"But the Quebec factory has also shown that, under the right circumstances, even corn ethanol can have some environmental advantage: it only uses local and sustainable surplus maize."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	This means that it is grown with low energy consumption and does not have to be transported over long distances.	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The ethanol plant also uses electricity generated in a relatively clean manner.	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"Thus, the burning of ethanol produces a reduction of 240,000 tons of CO2 per year, compared to an equivalent amount of fossil fuel."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"In general, Europe and the United States will have to move away from vegetable oils, Denruyter said."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"But even with these crops, if you have the right incentives, you can greatly improve the greenhouse gas profile."	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	Biofuel	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"A biofuel is a fuel that is produced through contemporary processes from biomass, rather than a fuel produced by the very slow geological processes involved in the formation of fossil fuels, such as oil."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Since biomass can technically be used as a direct fuel (e.g.	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"wood logs), some people use the terms biomass and biofuel interchangeably."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"Most of the time, however, the word biomass simply denotes the biological raw material from which the fuel is made, or some form of thermally/chemically altered solid final product, such as pellets or turned briquettes."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The word biofuel is usually reserved for liquid or gaseous fuels used for transport.	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	The EIA (U.S. Energy Information Administration) follows this practice [ref].	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"If biomass used in biofuel production can grow again rapidly, fuel is generally considered a form of renewable energy."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	Biofuels can be produced from plants (i.e. from plants).	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	"Renewable biofuels generally involve contemporary carbon fixation, such as those occurring in plants or microalgae through the photosynthesis process."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"Some argue that biofuels can be carbon neutral because all biomass crops sequester carbon to some extent, basically all crops transfer CO2 from the circulation over the soil to storage under the soil in the roots and surrounding soil."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"For example, McCalmont et al."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"an underground carbon accumulation ranging from 0.42 to 3.8 tons per hectare per year for soils below Miscanthus x giant energy crops [ref] has been found, with an average accumulation rate of 1.84 tons (0.74 tons per acre per year) [ref], or 20% of total carbon harvested per year [ref]."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"However, the simple proposal that biofuels are carbon neutral almost by definition has been replaced by the more nuanced proposal that for a specific biofuel project to be carbon neutral, the total carbon sequestered by the root energy crop system must offset all emissions on the ground (related to this specific biofuel project)."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	This includes emissions caused by direct or indirect changes in land use.	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"Many first-generation biofuels projects are not carbon neutral, given these demands."	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	"However, some are carbon neutral or even negative, especially perennial crops."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"The amount of carbon seized and the amount of GHGs (greenhouse gases) emitted will determine whether the total life-cycle cost of a biofuels project is positive, neutral or negative."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	A negative carbon life cycle is possible if total underground carbon accumulation more than offsets total GHG emissions above the life cycle soil.	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"In other words, to achieve carbon neutrality, yields should be high and emissions should be low."	0

Should you subsidize biofuels	"Despite these efforts, however, falling biofuels represent only a small percentage (about 2 per cent) of global biofuels markets."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"... Due to increased processing requirements and resources (e.g. hydrogen and catalysts) required to produce low biofuels compared to conventional biofuels, large-scale low-cost biofuel production is not expected to occur in the near-middle-term period."	0
Should you subsidize biofuels	"Rather, specific policies will be needed to promote the development and commercialization of such fuels before they become important contributors to global biofuel production."	0

Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Internet gambling: Prohibition v. Legalization	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	My testimony today will describe some of the factors that will frustrate attempts to ban gambling on the Internet and force its eventual legalization.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	I will focus on three factors:	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"First, Internet technology makes the ban pointless."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"The inherently open architecture of the Internet already hinders law enforcement officials, while unrelenting technological innovation ensures that they will only fall further and further."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Secondly, as an international network, the Internet offers an instant diversion around purely national prohibitions."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"The principles of national sovereignty will prevent the U.S. from forcing other countries to impose a ban on gambling on the Internet, and only a safe port abroad is needed to ensure that U.S. citizens can bet on the Internet."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Thirdly, consumer demand for gambling on the Internet and demand for tax revenues from States will create enormous political pressure for legalisation."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"The police community, which until recently enjoyed media attention, will quickly find its calls for prohibition drowned by these and other political forces."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Since the hard and cold facts about the inevitable failure of the ban will certainly depress some decent and well-intentioned people, I will ferment my analysis with some comforting words about online gambling."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	A dispassionate account reveals that online gambling offers several benefits:	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Internet gambling will drive the development of the network;	-1
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	It will provide a healthier environment than real world casinos; and	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	It will benefit consumers by increasing competition in gambling services.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Before I go into the details of why legalization will overcome the ban on gambling on the Internet, and why that result should not cause great alarm, let me clarify a preliminary objection."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Some advocates of the ban on gambling on the Internet argue that if the ban does not work, no regulation system will work either."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(1) However, this argument does not fully understand a basic principle of governance: regulations can be successful even when the ban fails if they offer benefits that exceed their burdens."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	That's why people don't shoot craps illegally in Vegas alleys.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"In the case of online gambling, the benefits of winning an official stamp of approval could convince an online casino to submit to regulation, even if that same casino could easily circumvent a total ban on its business."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	How much regulation will the Internet gambling industry tolerate?	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"In all probability, not much--but only practical experience can solve that issue."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Internet Technology Renders ProhibitionFutile	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The Internet architecture itself makes the prohibition of gambling useless.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"In contrast to telephone communications, which normally travel through circuit-switched networks, Internet communications use packet switching."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Each Internet message is broken into discrete packages, which travel through various routes and unpredictable until they are received and reassembled at the destination of the thematic message."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"In other words, sending a message over the Internet is a little like reciprocating with someone writing a letter, cutting it and sending each piece separately to the same address."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"The recipient may arm it, but anyone who notices its correspondence has a more difficult path."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Understanding Internet communications as an example of the postal system clarifies why the ban on gambling simply won't work.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Imagine telling the postal service to take vigorous action against all letters that transmit information used in illegal gambling.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	I would rightly object that he already has his hands full only by delivering the mail and that he lacks the equipment and staff to snoop through each letter.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Furthermore, it notes that it cannot always determine which messages relate to illegal activities."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	People bet and bet on everyday conversations where players often talk in code.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"In the meantime, email service customers will strongly oppose the postal service going through their mail."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Prohibitionists also cannot expect the postal service to simply stop delivering mail to and from certain addresses associated with illegal gambling.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The postal service shall again oppose the charges for the implementation of such a programme.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Citizens will again object to law enforcement officials spying on private correspondence.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"However, more importantly, trying to cut certain directions simply will not stop betting."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The players will be at the post office.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	", they can change at a time of warning, and simply leave outgoing correspondence without return address."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	All these considerations apply equally or more strongly to online gambling.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Compared to the postal system, the Internet facilitates encryption of messages, changing addresses and sending and receiving messages anonymously.Internet service providers would therefore find it impossible to discriminate between information about illegal games and other Internet traffic."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"In addition, unlike the quasi-public and monolithic postal system, the Internet has thousands of separate and fully private service providers to carry out its deliveries."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	All of them would shrillly oppose the burden of imposing a ban on Internet traffic.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	More than a few would simply refuse to cooperate.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Does that sound like a pessimistic story?	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"On the contrary, it only describes the current situation."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"As technological innovation continues to drive the development of communications on the Internet, law enforcement officials will fall further and further behind illegal players."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Given these technological limitations, the ban on Internet gambling will clearly not work as intended."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"However, as an undesirable side effect, the ban would seriously compromise the cost, efficiency and security of Internet communications."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Given the inevitable failure of technical solutions, the legalization of gambling on the Internet offers the only viable solution."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Online gambling can escape domestic bans	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Prohibiting Internet gaming services in the country will simply boost business abroad.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Federal law enforcement officials admit that they cannot stop gambling operations abroad.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	International online gambling?	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"We can't do anything about it, said John Russell, spokesman for the Department of Justice, that's the conclusion."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	(2) Even Senator Jon Kylhas confessed that this would be a very difficult activity to regulate because we have no jurisdiction over the people in general who are doing so.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	-3	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Both practical and legal barriers prevent any internal ban on online gambling from having an international effect.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Because the Internet provides instant access to toolani sites, any national ban on the provision of gaming services will have to cover the entire planet to work."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"U.S. law enforcement can, and recently did, arrest local citizens accused of running gambling businesses on the Internet, but smartoperators will quickly learn to settle abroad and stay there."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	-4	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Games services can find a wide haven over the seas.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"A growing number of countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Antigua and Costa Rica, have decided to legalize and license Internet gaming services."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(5) The principles of international law, which protect the sovereignty of each country, prevent the United States from extraditing its citizens simply for violating national laws against gambling."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(6) In addition, the Sixth Amendment to the Bill of Rights of the Constitution prohibits criminal prosecution of those who remain abroad while operating gambling sites on the Internet."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	(7) Law enforcement officials in the United States cannot therefore arrest or convict anyone offering online gambling services from a safe port abroad.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The Powerful Demand for the Internet	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Americans love to bet.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Having already embraced traditional gambling, they will almost certainly extend a warm welcome to gambling on the Internet."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	At least 56% of Americans played in 1995.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	(8) Few Americans consider it immoral; a 1993 survey revealed that only 25% of non-representatives cited moral or religious reasons.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(9) According to current estimates, Americans will bet more than $600 billion in 1998, almost $2,400 per man, woman and child."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(10) About $100 billion of that amount will be spent on illegal gambling, demonstrating that Americans already pay little attention to anti-game laws."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	-11	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Regardless of its legality, Americans have already shown that they support the nascent Internet gambling industry."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Analysts estimate that of the $1 billion revenue generated by gambling on the Internet in 1997, about $600 million came from the United States."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(12) Online casinos will have a global income of about $7.9 billion by 2001, $3.5 billion of which comes from American consumers."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(13) Because the Internet provides instant access to gambling sites abroad and relative security against persecution, online gambling will grow no matter what prohibitionists want."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"However, soon, prohibitionists will have more than consumer demand to worry about."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Law enforcement agents have taken the mediaspotlight by telling scary stories and demanding new powers to crush online gambling.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"However, as the futility of the ban becomes increasingly apparent, the colder heads of state revenue departments will begin to view gambling on the Internet as a new and enormous cashcow."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"The ban simply ensures that Internet players will send their money to places like Antigua, New Zealand and Australia.State governors and legislatures will soon demand a share of that amount."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"The same political forces that have led to the generalization of the legalization of the lottery, the casino and the game of river boats will eventually lead to the legalization of the Internet game."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"In fact, this trend towards the legalization of gambling on the Internet has already begun."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Initially, Senator Kyl's Internet Games Prohibition Act of 1997 banned all types of online commercial contests, all over the United States, for all those involved."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(14) In the face of a storm of objections, he recently drafted an amendment to the bill that would allow for a variety of types of online gambling, such as the pooling of interstate bets and intrastate parimutuel and lottery bets."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	(15) Representative Bob Goodlatte once defended his own law to ban online gambling with the assertion that existing laws have been put in his head on the Internet because [n]ologer people have to leave the comfort of their homes to access casinos.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(16) In fact, however, nine states already allow their citizens access to professional gaming services at home through telecommunications devices."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(17) Legalized Internet games, far from revolutionizing American culture, will come as a natural extension of current social and technological trends."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	The Benefits of InternetGambling	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	I have set out a number of reasons why attempts to ban gambling on the Internet will inevitably fail and give way to legalization.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	But mere futility is barely enough to prevent bad public policy.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Let me therefore add a few reasons why we should welcome the legalisation of gambling on the Internet.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Internet gambling will encourage the private sector to develop network capacity and trade.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Just as real world casinos have competed to build the most innovative and attractive environments, so will Internet gaming services compete to offer the most eye-catching graphics and the most sophisticated user interfaces."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"That competition, as a pleasant side benefit, will result in wider bandwidth and better software for all types of Internet applications."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Critics of real-world casinos blame them for attracting consumers to windowless caves away from the real world, with game traps at every turn and free-flow alcohol."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Regardless of the validity of such criticisms, they certainly do not apply to gambling on the Internet."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"On the contrary, consumers who log in from home computers will find it impossible to escape phone calls, barking dogs and all the other distractions in the real world.Internet gaming thus offers a healthier environment than its counterpart in the real world."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Finally, we should never forget that players deserve all the benefits enjoyed by other consumers of entertainment services, including the benefits of competition."	-1
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"By offering consumers cheap and easy access to a variety of gaming opportunities, the Internet will bring competition to an industry that has long enjoyed the haven of highly restrictive licensing practices."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"Players will no longer have to fly to Las Vegas to play slots, drive to the nearest authorized track to play horses, or even walk to the corner store to play statelotto."	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	Consumers can already play these and other games at home through the many Internet websites (more than 50 years and growing) that offer gaming services.	0
Shouldn't online gambling be banned	"(18) Prohibiting gambling on the Internet will not make it inaccessible, as legalizing it will bring the benefits of increased competition into the rule of law."	0

Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is indivisible: an unlimited number of people can consume an intellectual property without being exhausted."	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"In addition, investments in intellectual property suffer from appropriation problems – while an owner can surround his land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, an information producer or an intellectual property can usually do very little to prevent his first buyer from reproducing it and selling it at a lower price."	0

Should there be a curfew for children?	The five main reasons for abolishing the curfew	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	Juvenile curfews are a violation of the fundamental rights of young people.	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	Both the United States Constitution and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child provide that freedom of movement and association is an important right.	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	"Federal courts have also recognized that the restrictions imposed by the curfew constitute a violation of First Amendment rights, such as freedom of expression and assembly, and have therefore removed many curfews that do not provide exemptions to freedom of expression."	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	"Along with the rights of the First Amendment, curfews violate fair and equal treatment under the law, as well as substantive and procedural due process, making them unconstitutional in other ways."	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	Curfew are ineffective in reducing crime.	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	A recent review of several studies on juvenile curfews stated that they were ineffective in reducing both crime and victimization.	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	"This supported an earlier review of the juvenile curfew studies, which also concluded that juvenile delinquency and victimization “are more likely to remain unchanged after the implementation of curfew laws” and that, when changes were observed, they were equally likely to reflect an increase in crime than a decrease."	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	"Indeed, some studies show that curfews can lead to an increase in crime."	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	"For example, in the District of Columbia there was a significant increase in the number of incidents of gun violence after the curfew was extended for only one hour."	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	"Investigators thought this was because “juvenile curfews change the number of witnesses on the streets, as well as the way the police are spending their time.”"	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	Juvenile curfews punish non-criminal behavior.	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	"Curfew violations are a type of state crime, which means that they criminalize behaviour that is illegal only because the person involved is under the age of eighteen."	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	"Status offences unjustly punish young people for activities that are not considered dangerous to society (otherwise, it would be illegal for everyone to do so)."	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	They are purely discriminatory and create criminals from law-abiding citizens.	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	"As curfews increase the likelihood of young people entering the criminal justice system, criminal justice reformers have begun to speak out against the “deprivation of liberty” and the penalties for breaking the curfew are not trivial."	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	"For example, in Lexington, KY, the penalty for violating curfew can reach a fine of $499, while the maximum penalty for speeding is $200."	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	This shows that the city of Lexington considers a young man walking the streets at night to be a greater threat to public safety than someone who exceeds the speed limit.	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	Juvenile curfews do not affect populations that commit the greatest amount of crime and waste police resources.	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	"With the exception of the elderly, juvenile delinquency constitutes the lowest proportion of all crimes."	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	"In fact, adults commit about 90% of crimes in the United States.Of course, older people would not tolerate such a severe restriction on their freedom or on the selection of an entire group."	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	"However, because police officers are forced to monitor, arrest and prosecute curfew violations, they are unable to direct their energies to dealing with truly dangerous behaviors."	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	This has led law enforcement officials to identify curfews as “a drain from police department resources”.	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	Juvenile curfews are often applied in a discriminatory manner.	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	There is ample evidence to show that people of colour are disproportionately affected by street police.	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	"Like “stop-and-frisk”, curfews can also disproportionately affect homeless people and those who try to escape abusive home life."	-1
Should there be a curfew for children?	"Curfew laws are strongly enforced in black neighborhoods, but not so much in white neighborhoods and white youth are less likely to be arrested by the police than Black youth."	0
Should there be a curfew for children?	"In fact, the city of Austin, Texas, put an end to youth curfews in 2017 after data revealed that “black and Hispanic youth were disproportionately cited.”"	0

Should intellectual property rights be abolished	The Economist has recently popularized the notion that patents are bad for innovation.	1

Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"In my opinion, this assessment is the result of too high an expectation of what patents or other intellectual property should achieve."	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	Critics of intellectual property rights seem to think that they should be tested if they actually increase creativity.	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"Similarly, in the area of competition law, commentators assume that it is necessary to balance innovation promoted by intellectual property with competition safeguarded by competition law."	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	This approach tends to be too strict on intellectual property rights.	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"In order to justify them and their exploitation on this basis, it is necessary to demonstrate that they actually achieve an increase in innovation."	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"On the contrary, in order for competition law to be applied, it is not necessary to demonstrate that its intervention would actually lead to an improvement in efficiency, but that it is necessary to maintain competition."	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"It is assumed that, at least in the long term, competition promotes greater efficiency."	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"Intellectual property rights should not be seen as an alternative to competition, but rather as essential to enable competition in factors such as innovation and quality."	-1
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"In the absence of protection of intellectual property rights, companies can often benefit from the efforts of a rival in these areas rather than strive to improve them."	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"In this respect, intellectual property rights are similar to tangible property rights, which are necessary to allow competition in production, otherwise it would be more profitable to steal products manufactured by a rival than to try to make similar products more efficiently."	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"Properly understood, intellectual property rights restrict competition in some factors (production and distribution) in order to enable and improve competition in others (innovation and quality)."	-1
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"Therefore, it is not really necessary to reconcile a conflict between the protection of intellectual property and competition, but rather the need to strike a balance between the different forms of competition."	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"This balance is largely provided by the rules of intellectual property law, which determine the scope of protection on a matter-by-matter basis."	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"However, competition law may further regulate this balance when the exploitation of intellectual property restricts competition in a way or to the extent that it is not justified for the protection of its specific object."	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"And if this is the case it can generally be proved by comparing the competition in all aspects (including innovation and quality) resulting from the conduct in question with the competition that would otherwise exist, taking into account the existence, ownership and justified scope of intellectual property rights (counterfactuals)."	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"If the comparison is negative, competition law should intervene in principle."	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"Both intellectual property and competition law allow economic operators to benefit better than other economic operators and therefore encourage them to strive to do so, i.e. to compete."	-1
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"However, the fact that there is more innovation, better quality or more efficient production or distribution depends on many other factors why intellectual property and competition law should not be held responsible."	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	Striving to improve is not always successful.	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"It should be considered sufficient that intellectual property and competition law provide a framework for economic operators to compete in innovation, quality and efficiency."	0
Should intellectual property rights be abolished	"We should look elsewhere, or wait a little longer, if in fact greater innovation, quality and efficiency are not achieved."	0

Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	"By providing transport subsidies for 5,792 potential seasonal migrants in Bangladesh seeking to escape the annual famine season, the authors identify the impact of increasing the number of migrant workers on the total number of migrants and income levels in rural villages."	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	The authors vary randomly the proportion of landless agricultural workers migrating in 133 villages in order to generate shocks in the supply of labour of different magnitudes in different villages.	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	They then use this variation to document changes in the overall wage and price balance due to the significant expansion of the seasonal migration subsidies project that Mobarak tested a few years ago.	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	"Indeed, these changes represent the way in which the project affects villages as a whole when the project is launched on a large scale with a large number of simultaneous migrations per village."	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	"Firstly, the authors consider that a higher proportion of migrants leaving rural villages during the famine season makes other people in the village more likely to emigrate as well."	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	"This suggests that there are some benefits of coordinated travel, so migrants can share the cost of leaving the village temporarily."	0

Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	"The construction of roads to previously unconnected villages leads to a reduction of 10 percentage points in the proportion of households and workers in agriculture, with an equivalent increase in participation in the wage labour market."	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	Roads allow people who used to work in agriculture to seek new and potentially better paid employment outside their traditional sector.	0
Should developing countries restrict rural-to-urban migration?	"This change in the sectoral allocation of labour is stronger among men and households with low levels of land, the population with the greatest potential to benefit from structural transformation."	0

Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	The various advantages of buying locally are explained in the following way and with examples.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	The first basic principle under the impulse to buy locally is that money remains in the same country.	1
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	This concept ensures that the money that has been used for consumer purchases within a country turns into it.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	This money can be used in other developments by the government or can be filtered to other consumers who will use it as well.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"If the money had been used and gone to another country, there would be a vacuum that would, to fill it, lead citizens to produce more or to seek buyers from outside the country (Cato 99)."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"It is common that when people buy locally, the price of products is reduced."	1
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	This concept is derived from the fact that locally produced products do not require specialized processing and packaging.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"These, in turn, if done significantly increases the cost of a product, as well as the transport of the product does."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	Eventually a locally produced and consumed product becomes cheaper compared to those coming from outside the country.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"In the end, all consumers benefit from low prices and the country if output increases achieves economic growth."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"Given that the manufacturers and producers of goods and services are actually employers, it means that if their products are purchased locally, they get more benefits."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	Such benefits will ultimately go down to employees working in such factories and their living standards improve when their wages and salaries are raised.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	Both the employer and the employee achieve stability over time as losses are reduced and businesses on a growth path.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"On the other hand, the government has its share when consumers choose to buy locally produced products."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"As more and more of these products are created, so does the business and in turn taxes referred to the government."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"In addition, when employees' wages and salaries increase, the taxes that go back to government increase and therefore the government gets more income."	1
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"In countries and especially in those seeking industrialization to promote local buying, they are in fact building a basis for economic growth."	1
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	The principle of local purchase also results in savings and local investment.	1
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	This stems from the fact that local entrepreneurs invest their profits in other business enterprises and also support the government in initiating worthy projects such as schools and local organizations.	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"What this concept achieves at the end of development in all parts of the country, regardless of the background of the people in that area."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"If people or consumers had taken that money to another country, they would be deprived of such development."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	"Local buying, as has already been seen to reduce the price of products, leaves an excess of unused money in the pockets of consumers."	0
Should we promote the purchase of domestic products	It is this money that people will tend to save for their future businesses.	0

Should we ban human cloning	Changes and gaps: regulation of human cloning around the world	0
Should we ban human cloning	Ethical considerations	0
Should we ban human cloning	Few regulatory areas are as probatively driven by ethical views as the regulation of cloning and research on cloning.	0
Should we ban human cloning	This is not the place for an in-depth analysis of the underlying debate.	0
Should we ban human cloning	"In other places, we have both argued that existing regulatory attempts to ban RC have rarely been supported by a reflective exposition of underlying ethical principles [5, 10, 34]."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"Policy statements are often based on statements that are tautologists, under certain, misconsidered, or a combination of these things."	0
Should we ban human cloning	Our claim here is more modest.	0
Should we ban human cloning	In this section we seek to show why attempts to understand the ethical basis of existing law cannot focus solely on existing regulatory outcomes.	0
Should we ban human cloning	"And, of course, the regulatory outcome does not necessarily represent a jurisdictional consensus on core ethical issues."	0
Should we ban human cloning	Lawyers rarely seek regulatory results to understand ethical debates.	0
Should we ban human cloning	"Unfortunately, in the area of cloning, many commentators do the same."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"As our initial quote shows, politicians and commentators are too willing to find support for their ethical views in the regulatory positions adopted elsewhere."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"However, there are different levels of ethical agreement."	0
Should we ban human cloning	The agreement on the appropriate regulatory position does not imply agreement on the underlying ethical principles.	0
Should we ban human cloning	Consider the relationship between ethical positions on the moral state (or dignity) of the cloned embryo and the NRC.	0
Should we ban human cloning	"The cloned embryo could be considered to have a complete, non-or limited moral status [18, 35]."	0
Should we ban human cloning	The full status position would give the embryo the same level of moral duties as you or me.	0
Should we ban human cloning	The position without status would not give the embryo more status or dignity than its hair or nails.	0
Should we ban human cloning	The limited status position would give the embryo a fixed or gradualistic level of intrinsic moral value between these two extremes.	0
Should we ban human cloning	The full status position will require the prohibition of NRC (destructive use of embryos is considered murder) and the non-status position will generally require NRC to be allowed (unless such an approach interferes with the moral interests of those who do matter).	0
Should we ban human cloning	"However, the limited status position is potentially compatible with either of the two regulatory positions, depending on the particular status given to the early embryo and the weight given to the potential benefits of NRC."	0
Should we ban human cloning	It follows that the fact that the regulatory position allows or prohibits the NRC does not even tell us what status the embryo is considered to have.	0
Should we ban human cloning	This is further complicated by the fact that supporters of the non-or limited status position may be willing to accept more restrictions than are strictly required by their position to protect a more important moral objective.	0
Should we ban human cloning	Only supporters of the full status position cannot make such pragmatic commitments in a coherent manner [18].	0
Should we ban human cloning	"Similarly, existing positions on resident coordinators could be based on radically different ethical views."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"The prohibitions could be supported by those who argue that RC is absolutely incorrect (for example, it always violates human dignity) and by those who argue that cloning today would be incorrect."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"Even the temporary ban does not allow us to discern whether it is based, for example, on the view that resident coordinators are wrong because of current security issues or on the view that resident coordinators are not wrong, but that the most effective way to do so is to prohibit them initially."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"In summary, most regulatory outcomes could be explained in a coherent manner with reference to one or more underlying ethical positions."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"Therefore, similar or even identical regulatory results imply less through an ethical agreement that some are inclined to believe."	0
Should we ban human cloning	Cloning laws and policies are far from uniform throughout the world and the legal situation in some countries remains uncertain.	0
Should we ban human cloning	This will give little comfort to scientists and policy makers in the hope of obtaining clear direction from the international position.	0
Should we ban human cloning	"For the time being, at least, policymakers must accept the reality of international dissent and scientists wishing to conduct research on NRC are advised to consider carrying out their research in only a handful of countries."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"Even where there is agreement on the regulatory outcome, policymakers should not confuse it with an agreement on the underlying ethical principles."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"Like many issues relating to the development of genetic and reproductive technologies, cloning remains controversial."	0
Should we ban human cloning	"Cloning humans often creates a debate on ethics in the ""Sixth Day""."	0
Should we ban human cloning	Many of our creation stories suggest that one deity produced two humans to begin populating our planet.	0
Should we ban human cloning	This scientific process would change that process so that natural reproduction was not the only way to have children.	0
Should we ban human cloning	Anyone could potentially be copied with some collection of cells and a laboratory environment that can grow a fetus.	0
Should we ban human cloning	"When we examine the advantages and disadvantages of human cloning, we ask ourselves deeper theological questions that may not have answers."	0
Should we ban human cloning	Would each copy have a soul?	0
Should we ban human cloning	Is consciousness transferred to the new body?	0
Should we ban human cloning	Does a human clone age faster than a offspring that is produced from more natural methods?	0
Should we ban human cloning	"These are questions that we may not need to answer yet, but the science of cloning is moving forward."	0

Should you stay away from online dating	"Relieving the static electricity from my sweater and rubbing a piece of dead skin off my lip, I sat in the chair of the 70s upholstery auditorium in a 100 percent unpleasant mood, with an attitude of “Why the fuck are we still talking about this?” I thought about writing about it, headline: “Why the fuck are we still talking about this?” (We went because we hosted a podcast about apps, and because every RSVP email feels so easy when Tuesday night in question is still six weeks away.)"	0
Should you stay away from online dating	"Fortunately, the part that argued that the proposal was true—Note to Manoush Zomorodi of Self and the co-author of Aziz Ansari's Modern Romance Eric Klinenberg—only brought anecdotal evidence about bad dating and bad boys (and their personal, happy marriages, sources of IRL)."	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	AI Changing the Paradigm for Robot Programming	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Artificial intelligence is changing the way robots are programmed.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Abbey and its Intelligence team are harnessing the power of AI to help industrial robots learn new and complex skills.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"His work evolved from the research of the co-founders at UC Berkeley, where they had a breakthrough in the use of imitation learning and deep reinforcement learning to teach robots how to manipulate objects."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	This video courtesy of UC Berkeley demonstrates the laboratory's innovative technology that led to spin-off.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	The start-up uses a combination of detection and control to teleoperate a robot.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"For detection, an operator wears a virtual reality headset that displays the robot's vision through its camera."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"On the control side, VR devices such as Oculus Rift and HTC Vive come with portable devices that the operator has in his hands."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"As the operator moves his hands, that movement is tracked."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	The coordinates and orientation tracked are fed to a computer that drives the robot.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"In this way the operator has direct control, like a puppeteer, over the movements of the robot clamps."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"We allow the human to embed himself inside the robot, says Abbeel."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	So now the human can see through the robot's eyes and control the robot's hands.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	He says humans are so skilled that there's no comparison between robot claws and our hands.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"When working through the VR system, the operator is forced to follow the limitations of the robot."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"You teach the essence of skill to the robot by demonstrating, Abbeel explains."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Doesn't mean it's robotically fast at that point.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"It will do so at a human pace, which is slow for most robots."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	That is the first phase (learning imitation).	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	You teach the robot through demonstrations.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Then in phase two the robot will execute the reinforcement learning, where it learns from its own trial and error, continues Abbeel."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	The beauty here is that the robot has already learned the essence of the task.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Now the robot just has to learn to speed it up.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	That is something you can learn relatively quickly through reinforcement learning.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"The operator who wears a virtual reality headset and holds teleopera motion tracking devices to a robot, showing him how to grab and manipulate objects so he can finally learn to perform new skills on his own using reinforcement learning."	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Applications include working with deformable objects that change shape during handling, such as cables, cables and textiles."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	The collection of cubes is another potential application.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Incorporeal intelligence raised $7 million in seed funds last fall.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Abbeel says they have been in conversations with more than 100 companies to understand their needs and determine if there is a good fit for technology, noting that the software is agnostic to the type of robot."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"We replicated its configuration in our office and then started collecting demonstrations and writing the code so that the robot would learn from those demonstrations, Abbeel says."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Then we coordinate with the partner company to make sure we're teaching the robot to its specifications.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"He says the types of partner companies include car, electronics or clothing manufacturers, also contract manufacturers, warehouse and logistics operations, and pharmaceutical, agriculture and construction companies."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"We're changing the way robots are programmed, Abbeel says."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	We write code for imitation learning and write code for reinforcement learning.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Once the code is in place, when you want a new implementation, we don't write new code."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Instead, we collect new data."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"So the paradigm goes from new software development for a new deployment, to new data collection for a new deployment."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Data collection is generally easier.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	It's a lower bar than the new software engineering.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Eventually, Incorporeal Intelligence will allow others to use this software to reprogram their robots by doing their own demonstrations."	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"CloudMinds Technology, a new startup founded in 2015, wants to be that common platform, marking itself the world's first robot operator in the cloud."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Robert Zhang says AI-powered robots will require the cloud to make them smarter and more capable.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"(Photo courtesy of CloudMinds Technology)The reason we wanted to create CloudMinds is because we feel that this is an opportunity to apply our telecommunications background to robotics and artificial intelligence, says Robert Zhang, Co-founder and President."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	We want to be robot operators.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Zhang, a PhD in computational mechanics, comes from consumer electronics giants such as Samsung, Microsoft and Apple."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"His co-founder, serial entrepreneur and CEO Bill Huang, was previously the Director General of the China Mobile Research Institute, where he led the development of the first Android project, among others."	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"The launch will provide a cloud platform and related services to companies that design and sell robot hardware, as well as a mobile network operator offering wireless communications services to its customers."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Although Zhang says his platform will work equally well for industrial robots and consumer robots, they are focusing on making consumer robots smarter."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"For a robot to do tasks in the domestic environment, the necessary AI is very powerful, Zhang says."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"For a robot to prepare a meal or double the clothes, these are very unstructured tasks."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	You can't realistically put AI's capacity on the robot.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"It is commercially impossible, because there are many different tasks."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	That's why artificial intelligence should come from the cloud.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"No matter what the robot was originally designed for, you can always have the cloud to make the robot more capable and intelligent, he adds."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	We're still a few years away from anything close to the Jetsons Rosie.	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Possibility of hostile AI that precedes friendly AI	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Is strong AI intrinsically dangerous?	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	An important problem is that hostile artificial intelligence is likely to be much easier to create than friendly AI.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Although both require great advances in the recursive design of the optimization process, friendly AI also requires the ability to make invariant meta structures under self-improvement (or AI could be transformed into something hostile) and an objective structure that aligns with human values and does not automatically destroy the entire human race."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"A hostile AI, on the other hand, can optimize for an arbitrary target structure, which does not need to be invariant under automodification [ref]."	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Fear of cyber revolt is often based on interpretations of the history of humanity, which is full of incidents of slavery and genocide."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	Such fears stem from the belief that competitiveness and aggression are necessary in the system of objectives of any intelligent being.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"However, such human competitiveness derives from the evolutionary background of our intelligence, where the survival and reproduction of genes versus human and non-human competitors was the central objective [ref]."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"In fact, arbitrary intelligence could have arbitrary objectives: there is no particular reason for an artificially intelligent machine (not to share the evolutionary context of humanity) to be hostile—or friendly—unless its creator schedules it to be so and not inclined or able to modify its programming."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	But the question remains: what would happen if AI systems could interact and evolve (evolution in this context means self-modification or selection and reproduction) and the need to compete for resources would create that self-preservation goals?	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	The AI's goal of self-preservation could be in conflict with some human objectives.	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Some scientists discuss the likelihood of cyber revolts such as those described in science fiction as The Matrix, claiming that any artificial intelligence powerful enough to threaten humanity is more likely to be programmed not to attack it[necessary quote]."	0

Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"General Artificial Intelligence researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky has stated in this note that, probabilistically, humanity is less likely to be threatened by deliberately aggressive AIs than by AIs that were programmed in such a way that their objectives are involuntarily incompatible with human survival or well-being (as in film I, Robot and in The Evitable Conflict)."	0
Will artificial intelligence replace humans	"Steve Omohundro suggests that current automation systems are not designed for safety and that AIs can blindly optimize narrow utility functions (e.g. playing chess at all costs), leading them to seek self-preservation and removal of obstacles, including humans who could disable them [ref]."	0
